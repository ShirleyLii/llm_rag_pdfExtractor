When the \\nbrain can no longer compensate and cognitive problems \\ninterfere with a person’s ability to perform everyday tasks \\nsuch as driving, cooking or cleaning, a person is said to \\nhave dementia. \\nWhile Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of \\ndementia, it is not the only one (see Table 1, page 6).  \\nOther causes include cerebrovascular disease, \\ndegeneration of the front and temporal lobes of the \\nbrain, and accumulation of proteins called Lewy bodies. \\nOften, individuals have the brain changes of more than \\none cause of dementia. When imaging studies, \\ncerebrospinal fluid analysis or other tests show that the \\nbrain changes are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, \\nindividuals are said to have dementia due to Alzheimer’s \\ndisease or Alzheimer’s dementia.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is progressive, meaning the brain \\nchanges and symptoms worsen with time. How quickly  \\nit progresses from year to year and what abilities are \\naffected vary from person to person. Like all people, \\nindividuals with Alzheimer’s have good days and bad days. \\nOn good days, their cognitive skills may be markedly \\nimproved and they may be better able to carry out \\neveryday activities. On bad days, their cognitive skills may \\nbe worse and they may have more difficulty carrying out \\neveryday activities. Each day may be quite different.\\nDementia or Alzheimer’s Disease?\\nMany people wonder what the difference is \\nbetween dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. \\nDementia is an overall term for a particular \\ngroup of symptoms . Dementia symptoms \\ninclude trouble with memory, language and \\nproblem-solving; difficulty concentrating; \\nand struggling to understand and express \\nthoughts. Other symptoms are confusion, \\npoor judgment and acting impulsively, among \\nothers. Dementia symptoms are the result \\nof changes in the brain. Many different \\nconditions can cause dementia symptoms \\n(see Table 1, page 6). \\nAlzheimer’s disease is one cause of dementia \\nsymptoms . The brain changes of Alzheimer’s \\ndisease include the excessive accumulation \\nof the protein fragment beta-amyloid and \\nof an abnormal form of the protein tau. \\nOther brain changes include inflammation \\nand decreased ability of the brain to use \\nglucose, its main fuel. When imaging studies, \\ncerebrospinal fluid analysis or other tests \\nshow that the brain changes are caused by \\nAlzheimer’s disease, individuals are said to \\nhave dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease or \\nAlzheimer’s dementia. \\nThe brain, like the heart, is an organ. Just \\nas coronary artery disease is a type of \\nheart disease, Alzheimer’s disease is a type \\nof brain disease. In Alzheimer’s, nerve cells \\nin the brain (called neurons) are damaged \\nand destroyed. The brain’s neurons are \\nessential to all human activity, including \\nthinking, talking and walking. The neurons \\ndamaged first are those in parts of the \\nbrain responsible for memory, language \\nand thinking, which is why the first \\nsymptoms of Alzheimer’s disease tend  \\nto be memory, language and thinking \\n(cognitive) problems. Individuals may also \\ndevelop changes in mood, personality or \\nbehavior, such as apathy, confusion and \\nincreased suspicion and fear.\\nFamily members, friends and professional caregivers play \\ncritical roles in keeping individuals with Alzheimer’s safe, \\nhealthy and engaged in the activities that are most \\nmeaningful to them (see the Caregiving section, page 48). \\nIncreased help from caregivers is needed as the disease \\nprogresses. For example, individuals in the mild functional \\nimpairment stage of Alzheimer's may require little or no \\nhelp with basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as \\ngetting into and out of a bed or chair, bathing, dressing, \\nusing the toilet, eating, and grooming, while individuals in \\nthe moderate functional impairment stage do require help \\nwith ADLs. Caregiving demands further increase when \\nneuronal damage and death extends to parts of the brain \\nthat enable basic physical function such as swallowing and \\nwalking. Individuals in this severe functional impairment \\nstage of Alzheimer's require help with all ADLs.\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='6 Alzheimer’s Association. 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.

This loss of mobility, along with cognitive \\nlimitations, can lead to the need for around-the-clock care. \\nHowever, even in this stage of Alzheimer’s when individuals \\noften have difficulty communicating verbally, it’s common \\nfor them to have short, temporary periods of lucidity when \\nthey may be able to communicate coherently and regain \\nsome functional abilities.\\n9-11 Behaviors such as clapping, \\ndancing and singing along to music can also occur.9 Ongoing \\nresearch is investigating these spontaneous events.12-14\\nAlzheimer’s disease is ultimately fatal, although many people \\nwith Alzheimer’s die of other common, coexisting conditions \\nof older age. Studies indicate that people 65 and older \\nsurvive an average of four to eight years after a diagnosis of \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, yet some live as long as 20 years.\\n15-23 \\nMany factors influence this. They include age at diagnosis, \\nhow far the disease has progressed at diagnosis, and whether \\nindividuals have other health conditions that may shorten \\nlifespan or complicate care. \\nThere is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer’s disease, and \\nthere is currently no cure. However, several modifiable risk \\nfactors for dementia have been identified and addressing \\nthose risk factors may delay the onset of symptoms and \\nresult in more years lived in good health (see page 20).  \\nIn addition, several treatments are available to help with \\nsymptoms, and two are available that change the underlying \\nbiology of Alzheimer’s and slow disease progression (see \\npage 14). Many studies are underway to expand and diversify \\navailable treatments as well as improve the quality of life of \\nindividuals living with dementia and their caregivers.\\nBrain Changes of Alzheimer’s Disease \\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are caused by \\nchanges in the brain. In Alzheimer’s, the brain’s neurons \\nare especially affected. A healthy adult brain has billions \\nof neurons, each with long, branching extensions.  \\nThese extensions enable individual neurons to form \\nconnections with other neurons. At such connections, \\ncalled synapses, information flows in tiny bursts of \\nchemicals that are released by one neuron and taken  \\nup by another neuron. The brain contains trillions of \\nsynapses. They allow signals to travel rapidly through the \\nbrain. These signals form the cellular basis of memories, \\nthoughts, sensations, emotions, movements and skills.\\nResearchers have identified many brain changes that \\nmay interfere with communication at the synapses and \\ncontribute to the neuronal damage and death seen in \\nAlzheimer’s. Two of the most prominent brain changes \\nare (1) the accumulation of the protein fragment \\nbeta-amyloid into clumps (called beta-amyloid plaques) \\noutside  neurons and other brain cells and (2) the \\naccumulation of an abnormal form of the protein tau \\n(called tau tangles) inside  neurons. Other changes \\ninclude inflammation, decreased ability of the brain to \\nmetabolize glucose (the brain’s main fuel) and brain \\natrophy (decreased brain volume). While some degree  \\nof brain atrophy is common in older age, even in people \\nwho are cognitively healthy, atrophy is accelerated in \\npeople with Alzheimer’s dementia.\\n24 Neuronal damage \\nand death (neurodegeneration) are believed to \\ncontribute to brain atrophy. \\nTiming of Brain Changes\\nResearchers have gained insight into the timing of these \\nbrain changes by studying people with rare genetic \\nmutations that cause Alzheimer’s disease for whom \\nlong-term data have been collected. Researchers have \\nfound that levels of beta-amyloid significantly increased \\nup to 22 years (average, 18.9 years) before symptoms \\nwere expected to develop (individuals with these genetic \\nmutations usually develop symptoms at the same or \\nnearly the same age as their parent with Alzheimer’s).\\n5 \\nAbnormal levels of the neurofilament light chain protein, \\na biomarker of neurodegeneration, were found to start \\nan average of 22 years before the median estimated age \\nof symptom onset.\\n7 Levels of abnormally folded tau \\nprotein increase when beta-amyloid clumps together as \\namyloid plaques, and levels increase as early as two \\ndecades before the characteristic mature tau tangles of \\nAlzheimer’s disease appear.\\n8 Researchers also found that \\nglucose metabolism starts decreasing up to 18 years \\n(average, 14.1 years) before expected symptom onset, \\nand brain atrophy up to 13 years (average, 4.7 years) \\nbefore expected symptom onset.\\n5  \\nBrain Changes as Biomarkers\\nThese brain changes are biomarkers of Alzheimer’s \\ndisease. Biomarkers are biological changes that can be \\nmeasured to indicate the presence or absence of a disease \\nor the risk of developing symptoms from a disease. For \\nexample, the level of glucose in blood is a biomarker of \\ndiabetes, and cholesterol level is a biomarker of \\ndisordered lipid metabolism, which is a risk factor for \\ncardiovascular disease. Great progress has been made in \\nmeasuring  Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. For example, \\nwe can now identify abnormal levels of beta-amyloid and \\ntau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid surrounding the \\nbrain), and an imaging technique known as positron \\nemission tomography (PET) can produce pictures showing \\nwhere beta-amyloid and tau have accumulated in the \\nbrain. In addition, many research groups are working on \\nblood tests for Alzheimer’s disease. If these blood tests \\nprove effective they could simplify and greatly accelerate \\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer’s.\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='9Overview\\nSigns of Alzheimer’s Dementia Typical Age-Related Changes\\nMemory loss that disrupts daily life:  One of the most common signs of Alzheimer’s dementia, \\nespecially in the early stage, is forgetting recently learned information. Others include asking \\nthe same questions over and over, and increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (for example, \\nreminder notes or electronic devices) or family members for things that used to be handled on \\none’s own.\\nSometimes forgetting names or \\nappointments, but remembering \\nthem later.\\nChallenges in planning or solving problems:  Some people experience changes in their ability to \\ndevelop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe \\nor keeping track of monthly bills. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to \\ndo things than they did before.\\nMaking occasional errors  \\nwhen managing finances or \\nhousehold bills.\\nDifficulty completing familiar tasks:  People with Alzheimer’s often find it hard to complete daily \\ntasks. Sometimes, people have trouble driving to a familiar location, organizing a grocery list or \\nremembering the rules of a favorite game.\\nOccasionally needing help to  \\nuse microwave settings or record \\na television show.\\nConfusion with time or place:  People living with Alzheimer’s can lose track of dates, seasons \\nand the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening \\nimmediately. Sometimes they forget where they are or how they got there.\\nGetting confused about the  \\nday of the week but figuring it \\nout later.\\nTrouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships:  For some people, having vision \\nproblems is a sign of Alzheimer’s. They may also have problems judging distance and determining \\ncolor and contrast, causing issues with driving.\\nVision changes related to \\ncataracts.\\nNew problems with words in speaking or writing: People living with Alzheimer’s may have trouble \\nfollowing or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea \\nhow to continue or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have trouble  \\nnaming a familiar object or use the wrong name (e.g., calling a watch a “hand clock”).\\nSometimes having trouble \\nfinding the right word.\\nMisplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps:  People living with Alzheimer’s may put \\nthings in unusual places. They may lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find \\nthem. They may accuse others of stealing, especially as the disease progresses.\\nMisplacing things from time  \\nto time and retracing steps to \\nfind them.\\nDecreased or poor judgment:  Individuals may experience changes in judgment or decision-making. \\nFor example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money or pay less attention to \\ngrooming or keeping themselves clean.\\nMaking a bad decision or  \\nmistake once in a while because \\nall the details of a decision were \\nnot considered.\\nWithdrawal from work or social activities: People living with Alzheimer’s disease may experience \\nchanges in the ability to hold or follow a conversation. As a result, they may withdraw from hobbies, \\nsocial activities or other engagements.

In stage 0, biomarker levels are  \\nin the normal range. Biomarkers are biological factors that \\ncan be measured to indicate the presence or absence of a \\ndisease or the risk of developing symptoms from a disease \\n(e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). For example, the level of glucose in \\nblood is a biomarker of diabetes, and cholesterol level is a \\nbiomarker of disordered lipid metabolism, which is a risk \\nfactor for cardiovascular disease. In stage 0, there is no \\nevidence of clinical change (that is, no evidence of changes in \\ncognition such as thinking, language and memory, and no \\nevidence of changes in function such as the ability to work, \\ndrive and perform other everyday activities).\\nClinical Stage 1\\nIn clinical stage 1, individuals do not have symptoms but do \\nhave biomarker evidence of Alzheimer’s disease, such as \\nthe accumulation of the protein fragment beta-amyloid or \\nan abnormal form of the protein tau in the brain. When \\nthese biomarker changes occur, the brain compensates for \\nthem, enabling individuals to continue to function normally. \\nIn stage 1 individuals perform within the expected range \\non objective tests of cognitive function. There is no \\nevidence of recent cognitive decline or new symptoms.\\nClinical Stage 2\\nClinical stage 2 is a transitional stage from being \\nasymptomatic to having a mild decline in cognitive or \\nneurobehavioral function. Decline represents a change \\nfrom baseline within the previous one to three years, and \\nthe declines have lasted for at least six months. People in \\nstage 2 may have subtle decreases in performance on \\nlongitudinal cognitive testing (but results are still in the \\nnormal range); have self-reported subjective cognitive \\ndecline; and/or have the recent onset of changes in mood, \\nanxiety or motivation not explained by life events. \\nIndividuals in stage 2 remain fully independent with no or \\nminimal functional impact on activities of daily living.\\nClinical Stage 3\\nIndividuals in stage 3 perform in the impaired/abnormal \\nrange on objective cognitive tests. The individual or a \\nfriend or family member notices a change in cognitive \\nfunction from baseline, or there is a change in results of \\nlongitudinal cognitive testing or neurobehavioral \\nassessments. Individuals in stage 3 perform daily life activities \\nindependently but cognitive difficulties may make it hard to \\nperform complex activities of daily living (i.e., they may \\nrequire more time to complete a task or may be less efficient \\nin completing a task, but they are able to complete it).\\nClinical Stage 4\\nIn stage 4 of Alzheimer’s disease, individuals have dementia \\nsymptoms with mild functional impairment. Most individuals \\nare able to independently perform basic activities of daily \\nliving such as bathing and dressing, but may need help with \\ninstrumental activities of daily living, such as paying bills, \\ncooking, shopping and managing medications. They are able \\nto function independently in many areas but are likely to \\nrequire assistance with some activities to maximize \\nindependence and remain safe. They may still be able to \\ndrive, work and participate in their favorite activities. They \\nmay need more time to complete common daily tasks and \\nmay rely on reminders more than in the past.\\nClinical Stage 5\\nIn stage 5, individuals have dementia symptoms with \\nmoderate functional impairment and require assistance in \\nperforming activities of daily living. They experience more \\nproblems with memory and language, are more likely to \\nbecome confused, and find it harder to complete multistep \\nbasic tasks such as bathing and dressing. They may become \\nincontinent at times, begin to have problems recognizing \\nloved ones, and start showing personality and behavioral \\nchanges, including suspiciousness and agitation. \\nClinical Stage 6\\nIndividuals in stage 6 have dementia symptoms and severe \\nfunctional impairment. They depend on others to perform \\nactivities of daily living. Their ability to communicate verbally \\nis diminished, and they are likely to require around-the-clock \\ncare. Because of damage to areas of the brain involved in \\nmovement, individuals may be unable to walk. As a result, \\nthey may spend most of their time in a wheelchair or on a \\nbed. This loss of mobility increases their vulnerability to \\nphysical complications including blood clots, skin infections \\nand sepsis (a condition that triggers body-wide inflammation \\nthat can result in organ failure). \\nThe Alzheimer’s disease continuum represents the progression of Alzheimer’s disease from brain changes that are unnoticeable \\nby the person affected to brain changes and symptoms that severely impair daily function.\\n53 How long individuals spend in each \\npart of the continuum varies and is influenced by age, genetics and other factors.54 In 2024, revised criteria for diagnosing \\nAlzheimer’s and identifying where it is on this continuum (called staging) were published.53 These criteria incorporate recent \\nadvances in biomarkers to provide objective data for making a diagnosis and assigning a clinical stage (0 to 6) to the progression \\nof the disease (see Table 3a).

Some studies report that the majority \\nof people with the brain changes of Alzheimer’s disease \\nalso have the brain changes of a second cause of \\ndementia on autopsy.\\n25, 26 One autopsy study showed \\nthat of 447 older people who were believed to have \\nAlzheimer’s dementia when they died, only 3% had the \\nbrain changes of Alzheimer’s disease alone, while 15% \\nhad the brain changes of an entirely different cause of \\ndementia, and 82% had the brain changes of Alzheimer’s \\ndisease plus at least one other cause of dementia.\\n25 \\nStudies suggest that mixed dementia is the norm, not \\njust for those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia \\nbased on symptoms, but also for those diagnosed with \\nother types of dementia.\\n42, 43 \\nMixed dementia is especially common at advanced \\nages.\\n36, 44 For example, those age 85 or older are more \\nlikely than those younger than 85 to have evidence of \\ntwo or more causes of dementia. 32, 33 Having Alzheimer’s \\nbrain changes plus brain changes of another type of \\ndementia increases one’s chances of having dementia \\nsymptoms in one’s lifetime compared with having \\nAlzheimer’s brain changes alone.\\n25, 36 Mixed dementia \\nmay also account for the wide variety of memory and \\nthinking problems experienced by people living with \\ndementia. It is currently not possible to determine with \\ncertainty which symptoms an individual is experiencing \\nare due to which cause of dementia. The brain changes \\nof Alzheimer’s disease are the most common contributor \\nto dementia. \\nCognitive and Behavioral Changes of \\nAlzheimer’s Dementia\\nThe differences between normal age-related cognitive \\nchanges and the cognitive and behavioral changes of \\nAlzheimer’s can be subtle, especially in the first dementia \\nstage of Alzheimer’s, called stage 4 or dementia with \\nmild functional impairment (see Tables 2 and 3, pages  \\n9 and 11, respectively).\\nAn example of a subtle change is difficulty making  \\nsound financial decisions. The U.S. Social Security \\nAdministration notes that people living with dementia \\nare at an especially high risk of becoming victims of \\nfraud and financial abuse.\\n45 This may be because \\nhandling finances is a particularly complex cognitive \\nactivity made even harder by declines in executive \\nfunction. Executive function comprises the higher-level \\ncognitive skills used to control and coordinate other \\ncognitive abilities and behaviors.\\n46 Declines in executive \\nfunction can play out as difficulty planning, organizing \\nand carrying out tasks, as well as poor judgment, socially \\ninappropriate behavior, and inability to understand how \\none’s behavior or choices affect others. 47 Impaired \\nexecutive function not only makes it challenging for \\nindividuals with Alzheimer’s dementia to manage \\nfinances, but may also make them especially vulnerable \\nto financial abuse and scams because their ability to \\ndiscern between well-intentioned and ill-intentioned \\nbehavior and language in others may be diminished. As \\nthe underlying disease progresses, these changes can \\nbecome more pronounced, leading to difficulties with \\ntasks needed for independent living, such as paying bills. \\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that in the \\nyears prior to diagnosis of a memory disorder, average \\ncredit scores begin to weaken and payment delinquency \\nbegins to increase, both overall and for mortgage and \\ncredit card accounts specifically.\\n48 Credit outcomes \\nconsistently deteriorate over the quarters leading up  \\nto diagnosis.\\nOther common symptoms in stage 4 include problems \\ncoming up with the right word or name, new or \\nincreased trouble with planning or organizing, losing or \\nmisplacing objects, forgetting material that was just \\nread, and difficulty remembering names when \\nintroduced to new people.\\nThe brain changes of Alzheimer’s continue over the \\ncourse of the disease, and as brain changes increase, \\nbehavioral changes become more pronounced. In  \\nstage 5, dementia with moderate functional impairment, \\nindividuals may become confused about where they are \\nand unable to remember their address or phone number; \\nrequire help choosing the proper clothing for the  \\nseason or occasion; experience changes in sleep \\npatterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming \\nrestless at night; and have personality and behavioral \\nchanges, including suspiciousness, delusions and \\ncompulsive, repetitive actions such as hand-wringing or \\ntissue shredding.\\nA behavioral change of special concern is known as \\nwandering. Wandering is when individuals walk away \\nfrom caregivers, home, or other people or settings. It is \\nestimated that between 35% and 60% of people with \\ndementia will wander at least once.\\n49, 50 For the person \\nwith dementia, wandering is likely an intentional effort \\nto reach a destination, such as work (although the \\nperson may no longer be employed) or important people \\nor places from their present or past. Because of memory \\nproblems and other cognitive changes, the individual \\nmay not be able to retrace their steps and may become \\nlost.

They do not slow, stop or \\nreverse the underlying brain changes that cause \\nAlzheimer’s, nor do they slow or stop the course of the \\ndisease. Instead, they help compensate for the brain \\nchanges of Alzheimer’s by altering neurotransmitter \\nlevels. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that brain cells \\nuse to communicate with each other. Memantine \\nprotects the brain from excessive levels of a \\nneurotransmitter called glutamate, which overstimulates \\nneurons and can damage them, while the remaining \\ndrugs increase the amount of the neurotransmitter \\nacetylcholine.\\nThese five drugs may have side effects, such as \\nheadaches and nausea. These are not all the possible  \\nside effects. As with lecanemab and donanemab, \\nindividuals should talk with their doctors to develop a \\ntreatment plan that is right for them, including weighing \\nthe benefits and risks of all therapies.\\nOne of the FDA-approved drugs, brexpiprazole, treats \\nagitation that can occur in Alzheimer’s. Agitation is \\ncommon in Alzheimer’s disease, with 60% of people  \\nwith MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease and 76% of people \\nwith Alzheimer’s dementia experiencing agitation.\\n62 \\nBrexpiprazole is thought to lessen agitation through its \\neffects on dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain. \\nBrexpiprazole is also FDA-approved for the treatment of \\nmajor depressive disorder in people without Alzheimer’s. \\nIt’s important to note that brexpiprazole falls into a \\ncategory of drugs called atypical antipsychotic drugs. \\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with an \\nincreased risk of stroke and death in older people with \\ndementia-related psychosis.\\n63-65 Non-drug interventions \\nshould be tried first. \\nIn addition, the drug suvorexant, approved for insomnia \\nin the general public, has been shown in clinical trials to \\nbe effective in treating problems with falling asleep and \\nstaying asleep that can occur in people with mild to \\nmoderate Alzheimer’s dementia. Suvorexant inhibits the \\nactivity of orexin, a type of neurotransmitter involved  \\nin the sleep-wake cycle. Possible side effects include,  \\nbut are not limited to, impaired alertness and motor \\ncoordination (including impaired driving), worsening of \\ndepression or suicidal thinking, developing complex sleep \\nbehaviors (such as sleep-walking and sleep-driving), and \\nexperiencing sleep paralysis.\\nWhy insomnia and other sleeping problems occur in \\npeople living with Alzheimer’s is unclear. However, \\nresearchers have found that Alzheimer’s brain changes \\ndisrupt the sleep-wake cycle, leading to increased sleep \\nfragmentation and wakefulness and decreased slow-\\nwave sleep.\\n66 Researchers have also found that sleep \\nabnormalities accelerate the accumulation of beta-\\namyloid and release of toxic tau in the brain, increasing \\nthe risk of dementia. In this way, sleep problems may be \\nbidirectional, with Alzheimer’s disease increasing the risk \\nof sleep disturbances and sleep disturbances increasing \\nthe risk of Alzheimer’s.\\n66, 67 More research is needed to \\nbetter understand the relationship between sleep \\nabnormalities and Alzheimer’s.

This is called late-onset \\nAlzheimer’s dementia. Experts believe that Alzheimer’s \\ndementia, like other common chronic diseases and \\nconditions, develops as a result of multiple factors rather \\nthan a single cause. Exceptions are cases of Alzheimer’s \\nrelated to trisomy 21 in Down syndrome and rare cases of \\nAlzheimer’s disease related to specific genetic mutations.\\nNon-Modifiable Risk Factors: Age, Genetics and  \\nFamily History\\nThe greatest risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia are \\nolder age,\\n74, 75 genetics — especially the e4 form of the \\napolipoprotein E (APOE) gene 76, 77 — and having a family \\nhistory of Alzheimer’s dementia. 78-81 \\nAge\\nAge is the greatest of these three risk factors. The \\npercentage of people with Alzheimer’s dementia \\nincreases dramatically with age. Five percent of people \\nage 65 to 74, 13.2% of people age 75 to 84, and 33.4% \\nof people age 85 or older have Alzheimer’s dementia \\n(see Prevalence section, page 29). The aging of the \\npopulation, by which older adults comprise a larger share \\nof the population, will significantly increase the number of \\npeople in the United States with Alzheimer’s dementia.\\n82 \\nHowever, it is important to note that Alzheimer’s \\ndementia is not a normal part of aging, and older age \\nalone is not sufficient to cause Alzheimer’s dementia. 83\\nGenetics \\nResearchers have found variants of many genes that \\nincrease or decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  \\nAt least 75 genetic variants are associated with an \\nincreased risk of Alzheimer’s. 84 Of the many genes that \\nincrease risk, APOE-e4 has the strongest impact on risk \\nof late-onset Alzheimer’s dementia. APOE provides the \\nblueprint for a protein that transports cholesterol in the \\nbloodstream. Everyone inherits one of three forms \\n(alleles) of the APOE gene — e2, e3 or e4 — from each \\nparent, resulting in six possible APOE pairs: e2/e2,  \\ne2/e3, e2/e4, e3/e3, e3/e4 and e4/e4.\\nHaving the e4 form of APOE increases one’s risk of \\ndeveloping late-onset Alzheimer’s dementia compared \\nwith having the e3 or e2 forms but does not guarantee \\nthat an individual will develop Alzheimer’s dementia. \\nHaving the e2 form may decrease one’s risk compared \\nwith having the e3 or e4 form. Individuals with the e2 \\nform who develop Alzheimer’s dementia generally do so \\nlater in life than those without the e2 form. The e3 form \\nis thought to have a neutral effect on Alzheimer’s \\ndementia risk.\\nIn general, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia \\nincreases with inheriting one copy of the e4 form and \\nincreases further still with inheriting two copies of the \\ne4 form, compared with inheriting only copies of the e2 \\nor e3 forms.\\n83-85 For example, based on data from a \\nstudy in Europe and a study in the United States, of \\npeople age 65-69, the risk of developing dementia by \\nthe early to mid-80s was 5% to 7% among those with no \\ncopies of the e4 form, 15% to 16% among those with \\none copy, and 31% to 40% among those with two \\ncopies.\\n86 In addition, those with the e4 form are more \\nlikely to have beta-amyloid accumulation and Alzheimer’s \\ndementia at a younger age than those with the e2 or e3 \\nforms of the APOE gene. 87 \\nA meta-analysis including 20 published articles \\ndescribing the frequency of the e4 form among people \\nin the United States who had been diagnosed with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia found that 56% had one copy of \\nthe APOE-e4 gene, and 11% had two copies of the \\nAPOE-e4 gene.\\n88 Another study found that among \\n1,770 diagnosed individuals from 26 Alzheimer’s Disease \\nResearch Centers across the United States, 65% had at \\nleast one copy of the APOE-e4 gene.\\n89\\nMost of the research to date associating APOE-e4 with \\nincreased risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s dementia has \\nstudied White individuals. Studies of this association in \\nBlack and Hispanic populations have had inconsistent \\nresults. For example, some have found that having the \\ne4 allele did not increase risk among Black people,\\n90-92 \\nwhile other studies have found that it significantly \\nincreased risk.\\n93-96 In addition, researchers have found \\ndifferences in the frequency of APOE pairs among racial \\nand ethnic groups.\\n97-10 0 For instance, data show that a \\nhigher percentage of Black Americans have at least one \\ncopy of the e4 allele (see Table 4) than White Americans, \\nHispanic Americans and American Indian individuals.\\n90, 91, \\n97, 98, 100 Among individuals of African ancestry who have \\none copy of e3 and one of e4, those with a particular \\nvariant of e3 called R145C are at increased risk of \\ndeveloping Alzheimer’s dementia compared with those \\nwho do not have this variant. 101 Researchers have  \\nalso found that a form of another gene, the gene for  \\nthe ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA7) protein, \\ndoubles the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia in Black  \\npeople with ABCA7 compared with Black people  \\nwithout ABCA7.\\n94'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 20, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='Overview 19\\nTo better understand inconsistencies in the effect of \\nAPOE-e4 in Hispanic/Latino groups, one research \\nteam analyzed the effect of APOE-e4 in 4,183 \\nindividuals from six Latino backgrounds: Central \\nAmerican, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican \\nand South American.\\n102 They found that the effect of \\nAPOE-e4 on cognitive decline differed among groups, \\nsuggesting that factors related to geographic \\nbackground and genetic ancestry may alter the extent \\nto which APOE-e4 contributes to cognitive decline.

However, \\nindividuals who have or had a parent or sibling (first-\\ndegree relative) with Alzheimer’s dementia are more likely \\nto develop Alzheimer’s than those who do not have a \\nfirst-degree relative with Alzheimer’s dementia.\\n78, 85 Those \\nwho have more than one first-degree relative with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia are at even higher risk. 81 A large, \\npopulation-based study found that having a parent with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia increases risk independent of \\nknown genetic risk factors such as APOE-e4.\\n111 When \\ndiseases run in families, heredity (genetics) and shared \\nnon-genetic factors (for example, access to healthy foods \\nand habits related to physical activity) may play a role.\\nModifiable Risk Factors\\nAlthough age, genetics and family history cannot be \\nchanged, some risk factors can be changed or modified \\nto reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia (see \\nFigure 2, page 23). However, there is growing awareness \\nthat more research is needed to disentangle risk factors \\nthat are specific to Alzheimer’s disease from those that \\nare specific to other causes of dementia.\\n73 As mentioned \\nearlier, most people living with dementia have the brain \\nchanges of Alzheimer’s disease as well as one or more \\nother causes of dementia. Because Alzheimer’s is the \\nmost common cause of dementia, modifiable risk factors \\nfor dementia are often assumed to support a link \\nbetween the risk factors and Alzheimer’s disease \\nspecifically. However, this may not be true. Additional \\nresearch will help identify whether these risk factors are \\nshared across multiple causes of dementia or are \\ncause-specific. In this section we discuss risk factors for \\ncognitive decline and dementia generally, recognizing \\nthat it is unclear whether these are risk factors for \\nAlzheimer’s disease specifically.\\nThere is increasing recognition that risk factors might \\naccrue over the life course to result in dementia. For \\nexample, the risk of developing dementia in later life  \\ncan be influenced by health factors present years  \\n(or even decades) earlier. Midlife obesity,\\n112-114 \\nhypertension 95, 112, 115, 116 and high cholesterol 117 are \\namong the midlife factors associated with an increased \\nrisk of dementia in later life. Today, researchers are \\nlooking at potential risk factors present even earlier in \\nthe life course, such as during adolescence and young \\nadulthood, to understand how health factors \\nexperienced throughout one’s life span may affect later \\nlife cognitive health.\\n118-123 This life course approach \\noffers the potential to inform preventive measures \\nacross multiple stages of life.\\nThe 2024 report of The Lancet  Commission on  \\ndementia prevention, intervention and care identified  \\n14 modifiable risk factors that, if eliminated, might \\nprevent nearly half of dementia cases worldwide. 124 \\nThese factors are: education, vision loss, high \\ncholesterol, head injury, physical inactivity, smoking, \\nexcessive alcohol consumption, hypertension, obesity, \\ndiabetes, hearing loss, depression, infrequent social \\ncontact and air pollution. With the exceptions of \\neducation, vision loss, air pollution and infrequent social \\ncontact, these are midlife risk factors. Similar to The \\nLancet Commission report, a 2022 study involving more \\nthan 375,000 participants estimated that nearly 37% of \\ndementia cases in the United States were associated \\nwith eight modifiable risk factors, the most common'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 22, 'page_label': '21'}, page_content='Overview 21\\nbeing midlife obesity, followed by physical inactivity and \\nlow educational attainment. 125 The other risk factors \\nwere depression, smoking, diabetes, hearing loss and \\nmidlife hypertension. \\nResearchers are interested in not only the types of \\nmodifiable risk factors but also how those risk factors \\naffect different populations. For example, a 2024 study \\nof nearly 92,000 participants in the Multiethnic Cohort \\nStudy with an average age of 59 found that after an \\naverage follow-up of nine years, slightly more than \\n16,500 had developed Alzheimer’s or another dementia. \\nLooking more closely at the data, researchers calculated \\nthat modifiable risk factors accounted for 33% of cases \\namong Latinos, 29% among Native Hawaiians, 28% \\namong African Americans, 22% among White Americans \\nand 14% among Japanese Americans.\\n126\\nA number of reports other than that by The Lancet  \\nCommission also point to the promising role of \\naddressing modifiable factors to reduce risk of dementia \\nand cognitive decline, including those from the World \\nHealth Organization (WHO) and the National Academy \\nof Medicine.\\n127, 128 There are many potentially modifiable \\nrisk factors for cognitive decline and dementia — too \\nmany to discuss in a single report. This section focuses \\non some of the modifiable risk factors with substantial \\nsupportive evidence identified in The Lancet Commission \\nreport, the WHO recommendations and the National \\nAcademy of Medicine report.\\nCardiovascular Health, Exercise and Diet  \\nBrain health is affected by the health of the heart and \\nblood vessels. Although the brain makes up just 2% of \\nbody weight, it consumes 20% of the body’s oxygen and \\nenergy supplies.\\n129 A healthy heart ensures that enough \\nblood is pumped to the brain, while healthy blood vessels \\nenable the oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to reach the \\nbrain so it can function normally. One of the clearest \\nexamples of this relationship is how stroke, which occurs \\nwhen a blood vessel in the brain is blocked or bursts, \\nmarkedly increases dementia risk.\\n130\\nMany mid- and late life factors that increase the risk  \\nof cardiovascular disease are also associated with a \\nhigher risk of dementia. 131 These factors include \\nuntreated or uncontrolled hypertension, 95, 112, 115, 116, 132, 133 \\ndiabetes 134-136 and smoking. 137, 138 Likewise, many factors \\nthat decrease risk of cardiovascular disease are \\nassociated with decreased risk of dementia.\\n139\\nPhysical activity in mid- or late life is an example of a \\nmodifiable factor that reduces risk of cardiovascular \\ndisease and may also reduce risk of dementia. 140-151 \\nAlthough researchers have studied a wide variety of \\nphysical activities, they do not know if specific types of \\nphysical activity are more effective at decreasing risk, or \\nhow the frequency or duration of physical activity may \\ninfluence the effectiveness of physical activity in \\nreducing risk. A recent systematic review and meta-\\nanalysis of 104 studies involving more than 340,000 \\nparticipants age 20 or older offers a different view of \\nthe impact of physical activity, stating that while physical \\nactivity was associated with better late-life cognition, \\nthe association was weak.\\n152 In contrast, a recent \\nmeta-analysis of data from nearly 12,000 study \\nvolunteers age 55 or older from 10 studies suggests \\nthat three to six hours of physical activity per week may \\nreduce risk of dementia\\n151 in older adults. More research \\nis needed to better understand the differences in the \\nstudy outcomes and the mechanisms by which physical \\nactivity may affect cognitive function across the lifespan.\\nIn addition to physical activity, many but not all studies \\nsuggest that consuming a healthy diet during mid-  \\nand/or late life may be associated with reduced dementia \\nrisk.\\n153-161 A healthy diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, \\nwhole grains, fish, chicken, nuts, legumes and certain \\nfats such as olive oil while limiting saturated fats, red \\nmeat and sugar. Examples of healthy diets include  \\nbut are not limited to the Mediterranean, DASH  \\n(Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) and  \\nMIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for \\nNeurodegenerative Delay) diets.\\n162-164 Related to  \\ndiet, some studies suggest that taking a multivitamin \\ndaily in later life may be beneficial to thinking, learning  \\nand memory in older age, but these data are \\npreliminary. 165, 166 It’s important to keep in mind that \\nindividuals’ metabolic and neurobiological responses to \\ndiet vary, and that a “one size fits all” approach to diet \\nmay not be effective in reducing risk of cognitive decline \\nand dementia. The addition or avoidance of no single \\nfood, beverage, ingredient, vitamin, multivitamin or \\nsupplement has been proven to prevent, delay, treat or \\ncure Alzheimer’s or any other dementia.\\n167\\nEducation \\nResearchers have long reported that people with  \\nmore years of formal education are at lower risk for \\nAlzheimer’s and other dementias than those with fewer \\nyears of formal education.\\n90, 168-173 Much of the research \\nlinking formal education to decreased risk of Alzheimer’s \\ndementia was conducted without the benefit of \\ntechnological advances such as PET imaging of the brain \\nthat might shed light on whether education affects \\nAlzheimer’s biomarkers such as beta-amyloid and tau \\naccumulation that lead to dementia symptoms.

Having a mentally stimulating job and engaging \\nin other mentally stimulating activities may also help \\nbuild cognitive reserve.\\n178-181 Recent research has found \\nthat among individuals at increased risk of dementia, \\nhigher occupational complexity is associated with  \\nbetter cognition. 178\\nToday researchers are investigating a wide range of \\neducation-related factors in addition to the number of \\nyears of formal education to better understand how \\neducation may affect cognitive function and dementia \\nrisk. One of these factors is education quality, with \\nemerging research suggesting that lower early-life \\neducational quality is associated with increased dementia \\nrisk\\n182, 183 and lower level of late-life cognitive \\nfunction. 184, 185\\nSocial and Cognitive Engagement  \\nRemaining socially and cognitively active throughout life \\nmay support brain health and possibly reduce the risk of \\nAlzheimer’s and other dementias. 140, 186-196 For example,  \\na study of more than 39,000 individuals from 13 \\nlongitudinal studies of aging found associations between \\ngood social connections (e.g., frequent contact with \\nfamily and friends, having a confidante or never feeling \\nlonely) and lower risk of dementia.\\n195 Another study \\nfound that the least socially active older adults (lowest \\n10th percentile) developed dementia an average of five \\nyears earlier than the most socially active older adults \\n(90th percentile).\\n197\\nIn terms of cognitive activity, a study of more than  \\n7,000 individuals found that those who had cognitively \\nstimulating occupations in their 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s \\nhad a lower risk of MCI and dementia when they were 70 \\nor older.\\n198 Another large study examined data on main \\nlifetime occupation for 7,637 individuals 65 or older in \\nthe Chicago Health and Aging Project study and found \\nthat higher occupational cognitive requirements \\ncorresponded to significantly better late-life cognitive \\nperformance at baseline and to slower decline in global \\ncognitive function over time.\\n179 Further, in a multicohort \\nstudy of 107,896 participants, the risk of dementia in \\nolder age was found to be lower in individuals with \\ncognitively stimulating jobs than in those with non-\\nstimulating jobs.\\n199\\nWhile socially and cognitively stimulating activities \\nappear to help build cognitive reserve, it is also possible \\nthat undetected cognitive impairment decreases one’s \\ninterest in and ability to participate in activities involving \\nsocial and cognitive skills. In this case, the association \\nmay reflect the effect of cognitive impairment on social \\nand cognitive engagement rather than the effect of \\nengagement on dementia risk.\\n192 More research is \\nneeded to better understand the mechanisms that link \\nsocial and cognitive engagement to dementia risk, along \\nwith types of activities that provide benefit.\\nSleep \\nAmong the many dementia risk factors being studied is \\ninadequate sleep or poor sleep quality. 200-202 Researchers \\nhave found that an important function of sleep is the \\nremoval of toxic beta-amyloid and other substances \\nfrom the brain.\\n203, 204 Inadequate or poor sleep may \\ncompromise the brain’s ability to remove beta-amyloid \\nand other toxins, enabling levels of toxins to remain \\nelevated. In addition, poor sleep quality such as that \\ncaused by obstructive sleep apnea may increase risk by \\ninterfering with blood flow to the brain and normal \\npatterns of brain activity that promote memory and \\nattention.\\n205, 206  As discussed earlier, many researchers \\nbelieve that the relationship between sleep and \\nAlzheimer’s disease is bidirectional, meaning that not \\nonly may poor sleep increase one’s risk of Alzheimer’s, \\nbut also that the brain changes of Alzheimer’s may \\nincrease the risk of poor sleep.\\n207-209 For example, \\nincreases in beta-amyloid and tau may interrupt the \\nsleep-wake cycle,\\n210 leading to increased sleep \\nfragmentation and wakefulness and decreased slow-\\nwave sleep.\\n66 Poor sleep may have similar bidirectional \\nrelationships with other causes of dementia, including \\npoor cerebrovascular health.\\n211\\nSensory Loss  \\nProblems with smell (olfactory dysfunction), hearing, \\nvision and other sensory abilities have been reported to \\nincrease one’s risk of cognitive decline and dementia.212, 213 \\nOlfactory dysfunction is linked to MCI as well as \\nneurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s \\ndisease.214-218 Problems with smell typically precede \\ncognitive and motor symptoms and may occur as a  \\nresult of the accumulation of beta-amyloid and \\nhyperphosphorylated tau in olfactory regions of the \\nbrain.\\n219 A community-based study of 380 older adults \\nwithout dementia who were followed up for up to  \\n15 years found that olfactory impairment was associated'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 24, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content='23Overview\\nwith faster cognitive decline and lower volume in the \\nfusiform gyrus and the middle temporal cortex regions of \\nthe brain. 220 These regions include the hippocampus and \\nentorhinal cortex, structures that play key roles in \\nmemory and language.\\nAge-related hearing loss has also been associated with \\nfaster rates of cognitive decline and dementia.\\n221-224 \\nAmong the reasons being examined are that hearing loss \\nplaces a burden on cortical processing, which directs \\nincreased resources to auditory processing at the \\nexpense of other cognitive functions such as memory. \\nAnother possible explanation being explored is that \\nhearing loss leads to social isolation, which has been \\nlinked to an increased risk of dementia.\\n225, 226 An \\nadditional explanation under investigation is that hearing \\nloss is an early manifestation of the underlying brain \\nchanges that cause the various forms of dementia. \\nResearchers recognize that these explanations may not \\nbe mutually exclusive but may all contribute to the link \\nbetween hearing loss and increased risk of dementia. \\nMore research is needed to better understand how \\nsensory loss increases risk of dementia.\\nAir Pollution  \\nThere is also rapidly emerging evidence on how \\nexposure to toxicants in the environment, especially  \\nair pollution, may be related to dementia risk.

In addition, better preventive health measures \\nand improved and expanded health care coordination \\nmay help to prevent critical illness and subsequent \\nhospitalization and the negative cognitive outcomes that \\nmay follow.\\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI)  \\nTBI is a head injury caused by an external force that \\nresults in disruption of normal brain function.\\n242 TBI is \\nassociated with an increased risk of dementia. 243-245\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (CDC), in 2020, people age 75 and older  \\nhad the highest numbers and rates of TBI-related \\nhospitalizations and deaths, accounting for about 32%  \\nof TBI-related hospitalizations and 28% of TBI-related \\ndeaths.\\n246 In 2018 and 2019, falls were the leading cause \\nof TBI-related deaths among those 75 and older. 242 \\nTwo ways to classify the severity of TBI are by the \\nduration of loss of consciousness or post-traumatic \\namnesia and by the individual’s initial score on the \\n15-point Glasgow Coma Scale. 247, 248\\n• Mild TBI (also known as a concussion) is characterized \\nby loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia \\nlasting 30 minutes or less, or an initial Glasgow score \\nof 13 to 15; alteration in mental state at the time of \\nthe accident, such as feeling disoriented, confused or \\ndazed; and focal neurological deficits (problems with \\nnerve, spinal cord or brain function focused at a \\nparticular location on the body), which may or may \\nnot be temporary. About 75% of TBIs are mild.\\n249\\n• Moderate TBI is characterized by loss of \\nconsciousness or post-traumatic amnesia lasting \\nmore than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours, or an \\ninitial Glasgow score of 9 to 12.\\n• Severe TBI is characterized by loss of consciousness \\nor post-traumatic amnesia lasting 24 hours or more, \\nor an initial Glasgow score of 8 or less.\\nModerate and severe TBIs increase risk of dementia \\nbetween two- and four-fold compared with risk among \\nindividuals without a history of moderate or severe \\nTBI.\\n250 In this case, the cause of dementia is almost \\nalways brain damage attributable to the TBI, not \\nAlzheimer’s disease. The risk of dementia increases with \\nthe number of TBIs sustained.\\n243-245 In addition, studies \\nhave found that people with a history of TBI who \\ndevelop dementia do so at a younger age than those \\nwithout a history of TBI. 251, 252 Whether TBI causes \\ndementia, other conditions that lead to dementia or  \\nboth is being investigated.\\nRepetitive TBI can cause a brain disorder called chronic \\ntraumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that results in dementia \\nsymptoms.\\n253, 254 The details of how this occurs is an \\nongoing area of research. Like Alzheimer’s disease, CTE is \\ncharacterized by tangles of an abnormal form of the \\nprotein tau in the brain.255 Beta-amyloid plaques may also \\nbe present, with one study indicating that more than 50% \\nof individuals with CTE had beta-amyloid plaques.255, 256  \\nThe brain changes of CTE can only be identified at autopsy. \\nThe greatest risk factor for developing CTE-related brain \\nchanges is repetitive brain trauma, defined as repeated, \\nforceful blows to the head that do not, individually, result  \\nin symptoms.\\n257 Among former amateur and professional \\nfootball players, the odds of developing CTE increased  \\n30% per year played.258 \\nSocioeconomic Status, Social Determinants of Health  \\nand Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia\\nSocioeconomic Status\\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is typically defined as access \\nto economic resources, including income, education, \\nemployment and occupation, but also includes factors \\nsuch as financial security and perceived social standing. \\nSES has many effects on one’s health that are relevant \\nto dementia risk. Researchers report that lower SES is \\nassociated with being less physically active,\\n259 having a \\nhigher risk of diabetes, 260-262 and being more likely to \\nhave hypertension 263 and to smoke 264 — all of which are \\nrisk factors for dementia (see Cardiovascular Health, \\nExercise, and Diet, page 21). In fact, in 2022 researchers \\nreported that SES was associated with changes in brain \\nanatomy, including gray matter volume, that may affect \\noverall cognitive ability.\\n265 WHO points out that “In \\ncountries at all levels of income, health and illness follow \\na social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic position, \\nthe worse the health.”\\n266'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 26, 'page_label': '25'}, page_content='25Overview\\nSocial Determinants of Health\\nSimilar to SES, social determinants of health (SDOH) \\naffect the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias. 267-269 According to WHO, “Social \\ndeterminants of health are the non-medical factors that \\ninfluence health outcomes. They are the conditions in \\nwhich people are born, grow, work, live and age, and the \\nwider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions \\nof daily life”. \\nSDOH may decrease one’s access to and ability to afford \\nfoods that support brain health; decrease one’s ability  \\nto afford health care or medical treatments, such as \\ntreatments for cardiovascular risk factors that are \\nclosely linked to brain health; and limit one’s access to \\nsafe housing, employment and outdoor areas in which  \\nto exercise.

Studies can show that \\nfactor X is associated with outcome Y in these \\ngroups, but cannot guarantee that any specific \\nperson with factor X will have outcome Y. As a result, \\nyou can \"do everything right\" and still have a serious \\nhealth problem or \"do everything wrong\" and live to \\nbe 100.\\n• Much of our current evidence comes from large \\nepidemiological studies such as the Honolulu-Asia \\nAging Study, the Nurses\\' Health Study and the Adult \\nChanges in Thought Study. These studies explore \\npre-existing behaviors and use statistical methods to \\nrelate those behaviors to health outcomes. This type \\nof study can show an \"association\" between a factor \\nand an outcome but cannot \"prove\" cause and effect. \\n• The gold standard for showing cause and effect is a \\nclinical trial in which participants are randomly \\nassigned to a prevention or risk management strategy \\nor to a control group. Researchers follow the two \\ngroups over time to see if their outcomes differ \\nsignificantly. It is important to note that the eligibility \\ncriteria for volunteers to participate in clinical trials \\nmay make them different from other people at risk \\nfor the outcome. \\n• It is unlikely that some prevention strategies will ever \\nbe tested in randomized trials for ethical or practical \\nreasons. One example is exercise. Definitively testing \\nthe impact of multiple different exercise programs, \\npracticed over the long term, on Alzheimer\\'s risk \\nwould require a huge trial enrolling thousands of \\npeople and following them for many years. The \\nexpense and logistics of such a trial would be \\nprohibitive, and it would require some people to go \\nwithout exercise, which has other known health \\nbenefits. Other risk factors such as smoking with \\nknown health risks cannot ethically be studied in a \\ntrial where persons are randomized to smoking  \\nor not smoking.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 27, 'page_label': '26'}, page_content=\"26\\nAlzheimer’s Association. 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.

This \\ndiscovery suggests that there is a substantial window  \\nof time in which we may be able to intervene in the \\nprogression of the disease. Biomarkers were critical in \\nthe research leading to FDA approval of lecanemab and \\ndonanemab, both of which slow disease progression  \\nin individuals with mild symptoms (stages 3 and 4). \\nScientific advances are already helping the field to make \\nprogress in the presymptomatic years. For example, \\nadvances in the identification of biomarkers for \\nAlzheimer’s disease make it possible to identify individuals \\nwho may qualify for clinical trials of treatments that \\ntarget these biomarkers and prevent or delay the onset of \\nsymptoms. Biomarkers also enable earlier detection of \\nthe brain changes of Alzheimer’s disease, giving those \\naffected the opportunity to address modifiable risk \\nfactors that may slow or delay cognitive decline. \\nBiomarkers are already accelerating the development of \\nnew treatments by making it possible for clinical trials to \\nspecifically recruit individuals with the brain changes that \\nexperimental therapies target. In addition, biomarker and \\nother research advances offer the potential to expand the \\nfield’s understanding of which therapies or combination \\nof therapies may be most effective at which points in the \\nAlzheimer’s disease continuum.\\nWhile blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers are \\navailable for use in research settings and some are used \\nin clinical settings to aid diagnosis of individuals with \\nsymptoms, at press time none had been approved by the \\nFDA for use in clinical settings. The further development \\nof blood and other biomarker tests holds much promise. \\nFor example, a study of more than 1,200 individuals in \\nSweden with cognitive symptoms showed that a blood \\ntest improved the accuracy of diagnosis.\\n273 Without the \\nblood test, primary care physicians were accurate 61% of \\nthe time in diagnosing Alzheimer’s based on standard \\ndiagnostic tests and practices. With the blood test, \\naccuracy increased to 91%. Accuracy also increased for \\ndementia care specialists, whose diagnosis was accurate \\n73% of the time using standard tests and procedures. \\nAccuracy increased to 91% for dementia care specialists \\nwhen the blood test was incorporated. \\nHowever, much remains to be understood about \\nbiomarkers and how they can best be used for diagnosis. \\nFor example, some studies have found that comorbidities \\ncan affect biomarker results and that biomarker levels \\nassociated with elevated risk of dementia may differ by \\nrace and ethnicity.\\n274-276 Fine-tuning diagnostic cut-off \\npoints for populations with different dementia risks and \\nincorporating an understanding of how coexisting \\nconditions may affect biomarkers are among the factors \\nthat will be of paramount importance in putting \\nbiomarker tests into everyday practice.\\nOnce blood biomarker tests are confirmed in large, \\ndiverse populations to be accurate and are widely \\navailable, they will have great potential for increasing \\nearly and accurate diagnosis and accelerating access  \\nto Alzheimer’s treatments for better clinical outcomes. \\nUntil then, clinicians considering using a blood test to \\nhelp with diagnosis are encouraged to refer to the  \\n2022 Alzheimer’s Association Appropriate Use \\nRecommendations for Blood Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s \\nDisease, 2024 Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and  \\nStaging of Alzheimer's Disease, and 2024 Alzheimer's  \\nAssociation Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnostic \\nEvaluation, Testing, Counseling, and Disclosure of \\nSuspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders \\n(DETeCD-ADRD).\\n277-280\\nWhen validated blood biomarker tests become available \\nfor routine use in health care providers’ offices and \\nother clinical settings, it will be important to provide \\neducational materials to help individuals and their \\nfamilies understand the risks and benefits of biomarker \\ntesting, make informed decisions about whether to \\nundergo biomarker testing, and know what to expect in \\ncare after testing. \\nOn a broader scale, disclosure of biomarker test results \\nmay have social and societal implications. For example, \\nbiomarker results that are positive for increased \\ndementia risk and that are shared with others may result \\nin individuals experiencing the social stigma and \\ndiscrimination so often experienced by people living with \\ndementia, even though individuals with increased risk \\nmay never develop dementia.\\n281\\nImportance of Communicating Study Results to  \\nStudy Participants\\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, keeping \\nstudy participants informed about research findings is  \\nas important as gathering the data.\\n282 Yet, in a survey \\ninvolving 1,488 individuals who had participated in \\nhealth research or been a guardian of a minor \\nparticipating in health research, 51.8% indicated they \\nwere given no opportunity to request study results,  \\n33% reported receiving results, 9.0% chose not to \\nreceive results and 6.2% indicated they never received \\nresults they had requested.\\n283 However, almost all \\nindividuals said researchers should always or sometimes \\noffer the results to participants.\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 28, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content='27Overview\\nLikewise, a study of 414 researchers from 44 academic \\nmedical institutions found that 64.5% of researchers \\nreported that results should always be shared with \\nparticipants, yet 60.8% of respondents could identify \\nstudies in which they had a leadership role where results \\nwere not shared.\\n284 According to the study, financial \\nbarriers (e.g., lack of money to fund efforts to share \\nresults with participants), systems barriers (e.g., lack  \\nof career-related incentives to share results with \\nparticipants), logistical/methodological/skill-related \\nbarriers (e.g., lack of knowledge about how to \\ndisseminate results to lay audiences) and ethical \\nconcerns (e.g., concerns about how participants will \\nunderstand or use the results) were each considered by \\nover 80% of respondents to be barriers to sharing \\nresults for at least some of their studies.\\nTo detail the wishes of participants in dementia studies, \\none group has developed a study participant’s bill of \\nrights focusing on participants’ right to receive study \\nresults.\\n285 This bill of rights was created by a committee \\nof study participants, care partners, representatives  \\nof dementia advocacy organizations, and other \\nstakeholders in dementia research for the Advisory \\nGroup on Risk Education for Dementia.

Other \\nsmaller groups, including older adults who are American \\nIndian or Alaska Native, or Asian American, or who identify \\nwith multiple races, are also underrepresented in \\nAlzheimer’s research. Lack of inclusion also limits our \\nability to understand whether and how dementia risk \\nfactors and interventions work in populations that carry \\ndifferent baseline susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease, \\nincluding those with Down syndrome.\\n288\\nOnly by improving representation in the participation \\nand leadership of clinical trials, observational studies and \\nother investigations will everyone have the potential to  \\nbenefit from advances in dementia research.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 29, 'page_label': '28'}, page_content=\"PREVALENCE \\nOver 7 million Americans  \\nare living with  \\nAlzheimer's dementia.\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 30, 'page_label': '29'}, page_content=\"29Prevalence\\nThis section reports on the number and proportion of \\npeople with Alzheimer’s dementia to describe the \\nmagnitude of the burden of Alzheimer’s dementia on \\ncommunities, health care systems and social safety nets. \\nThe prevalence of Alzheimer’s dementia refers to the \\nnumber and proportion of people in a population who \\nhave Alzheimer’s dementia at a given point in time. \\nIncidence refers to the number or rate of new cases per \\nyear, often expressed as the number of people per \\n100,000 who newly develop the condition in a year.

Alzheimers Dement 2025;21(5).\\nPrevalence Estimates \\nThe prevalence numbers included in this report are \\nbased on estimates of how many people in the U.S. are \\nliving with Alzheimer’s dementia; that is, the number of \\npeople living with the clinical symptoms described in the \\n“Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s Disease” (mild, moderate \\nor severe) portion of the “Alzheimer’s Disease Continuum” \\ndescribed in the Overview. \\nThe estimate of 7.2 million older adults who have \\nAlzheimer’s dementia comes from a single longitudinal \\nstudy in which participants were systematically evaluated \\nand then re-evaluated on a regular basis; those who \\nexhibited the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s dementia \\nwere classified as having Alzheimer’s dementia.\\nA2, 293  \\nA major advantage of this approach is that it attempts to \\ncapture all individuals living with the condition and does \\nnot rely on the diagnosis of people living with Alzheimer’s \\nby the health care system, a process that has resulted \\nin a substantial undercount (i.e., “underdiagnosis”) of the \\nAlzheimer’s population. The disadvantage is that the \\nlongitudinal study is located in a single, small geographic \\narea and may not be nationally representative (although \\nthe estimation process attempted to account for the \\ndemographics of the entire U.S. population). In the future, \\nFacts and Figures could report estimates of Alzheimer’s \\ndementia prevalence from multiple longitudinal studies or \\nusing different symptom-based diagnostic criteria; these \\ndifferences in criteria could result in different prevalence \\nestimates from what we report here.\\nAlmost all existing Alzheimer’s dementia prevalence \\nstudies are based on the identification of clinical \\nsymptoms to classify an individual as having Alzheimer’s \\ndementia; they do not rely on the brain changes believed \\nto be responsible for Alzheimer’s disease across the \\ncontinuum of the disease. As data sources, methods and \\nscientific knowledge improve, estimates of prevalence may \\nincorporate these brain changes using biomarkers. This \\naddition could lead to very different prevalence estimates \\nfor a number of reasons, which are discussed below.\\nEstimated Prevalence of Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s \\nDisease Based on Biomarkers and Dementia Symptoms\\nPrevalence estimates of dementia due to Alzheimer’s \\ndisease based on Alzheimer’s brain changes, as well as \\novert clinical dementia symptoms, are likely to be lower \\nthan the 7.2 million figure reported here. This is because \\nautopsy- and biomarker-based studies\\n25, 83, 295-297 indicate \\nthat some individuals counted as having Alzheimer’s \\ndementia based on symptoms do not have the biological \\nbrain changes defined as Alzheimer’s disease; that is, \\ntheir dementia is caused by something other than \\nAlzheimer’s disease. Both autopsy studies and clinical \\ntrials have found that 15% to 30% of individuals who \\nmet the criteria for clinical Alzheimer’s dementia based \\non symptoms did not have Alzheimer’s-related brain \\nchanges. Thus, these studies indicate that prevalence \\nestimates using biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease could \\nbe up to 30% lower than prevalence estimates based only \\non symptoms. This would translate to roughly 5 million \\nAmericans age 65 and older being classified as having \\ndementia due to Alzheimer’s disease in 2025.\\nEstimated Prevalence of MCI Due to Alzheimer’s Disease \\nBased on Biomarkers and Mild Cognitive Symptoms\\nFor decades, it has been recognized that all individuals \\nwith dementia pass through a precursor stage frequently \\nreferred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI; see \\nOverview). With the recent advent of biomarkers that \\ndetect the brain changes believed to characterize \\nAlzheimer’s disease, it may now be possible to determine \\nwhich individuals diagnosed with MCI have MCI due \\nto Alzheimer’s disease. The number and proportion of \\nolder adults who have MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease \\nare currently difficult to estimate because they require \\nstudies with both population-based prevalence measures \\nof MCI and tests of Alzheimer’s biomarkers, and this \\nline of research is in its infancy. Furthermore, there is \\nvariation across studies in both the threshold of cognitive \\nimpairment required for an MCI diagnosis and the \\nlevel of biomarker burden that defines the presence of \\nAlzheimer’s disease. However, we can roughly estimate \\nthis prevalence indirectly using multiple data sources. A \\nsystematic review of more than 30 studies of all-cause \\nMCI reported that about 17% of people age 65 and \\nolder had MCI.\\n298 The HRS HCAP study more recently \\nestimated the prevalence of MCI in people age 65 \\nand older to be 22%.173 Meanwhile, studies assessing \\nbiomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease with PET scans \\nhave reported that about half of people with MCI have \\nAlzheimer’s-related brain changes.\\n299, 300 Therefore, \\nroughly 8% to 11% of the 65 million Americans who  \\nare age 65 and older in 2025 — or approximately  \\n5 to 7 million older Americans — may have MCI due to \\nAlzheimer’s disease.\\n301 This estimate needs to be refined \\nwith population-based studies involving biomarkers and \\nmore precise estimates from narrower age ranges.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 34, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='33Prevalence\\nEstimated Prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease  \\nBased on Biomarkers and Any Cognitive Symptoms \\n(MCI or Dementia)\\nCombining the estimates of the prevalence of dementia \\ndue to Alzheimer’s disease and the prevalence of MCI \\ndue to Alzheimer’s disease provides an estimate of \\npeople living with the brain changes of Alzheimer’s \\ndisease and some form of cognitive impairment. This \\nestimate would include older adults with the earliest \\ndetectable stages of cognitive impairment who have the \\nbrain changes of Alzheimer’s but may or may not have \\nthe overt symptoms of dementia that interfere with \\ntheir ability to carry out everyday activities. Combining \\nthe estimates of roughly 5 million Americans age 65 \\nand older with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease \\nbased on Alzheimer’s brain changes and the 5 to 7 \\nmillion older Americans with MCI due to Alzheimer’s \\ndisease translates to approximately 10 to 12 million \\nolder Americans with Alzheimer’s disease and some \\nform of cognitive impairment in 2025. Furthermore, \\nbecause MCI develops years before dementia onset and \\ncan affect individuals younger than 65, there are likely \\nmore than 5 to 7 million people of any age with MCI \\ndue to Alzheimer’s disease, and thus the 10 to 12 million \\nestimate could be even higher if we consider Americans \\nof all ages, not just those 65 or older.\\nEstimated Prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease  \\nAcross the Entire Cognitive Spectrum\\nFinally, as measurements of the brain changes of \\nAlzheimer’s disease become more widely available in \\nresearch, we will be able to estimate how many people \\nhave Alzheimer’s disease regardless of the presence \\nor absence of dementia or any form of cognitive \\nimpairment. The total number of people living with the \\nbrain changes of Alzheimer’s disease is likely to be much \\nlarger than the number with MCI or dementia due to \\nAlzheimer’s disease given that there is an incipient and \\nsilent (i.e., “preclinical”) stage of Alzheimer’s disease \\nbefore the emergence of cognitive symptoms of either \\nMCI or dementia.\\n302 While this is still the subject of \\nongoing research, estimates are emerging of the \\nprevalence of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in the \\npopulation.\\n303, 304 More research is needed to validate \\npreclinical Alzheimer’s and determine how to measure it \\nwith biomarkers that conclusively represent Alzheimer’s \\ndisease, as opposed to other dementia-causing diseases. \\nWe also need to further understand if this preclinical \\nstage is a valid representation of people who may go on \\nto develop dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. When a \\nconclusive connection is shown between biomarkers and \\nthe preclinical stage, and when epidemiological studies \\ninclude biomarker-based diagnoses, it will be possible \\nto estimate the number of individuals throughout the \\nentire continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (i.e., those with \\nbiomarker-confirmed Alzheimer’s dementia, those with \\nbiomarker-confirmed MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease and \\nthose with biomarker-confirmed preclinical Alzheimer’s \\ndisease). The resulting estimated prevalence will exceed \\nall estimates presented in the current report.\\nFuture Facts and Figures  Prevalence Estimates\\nWhat does all this mean for future prevalence estimates? \\nFuture Facts and Figures  reports will continue to include \\nthe estimated prevalence of individuals in the Alzheimer’s \\ndementia stage, defined according to clinical symptoms, \\ncurrently estimated at 7.2 million Americans, in addition \\nto the best available estimated prevalence of MCI due \\nto Alzheimer’s disease. Accurate, up-to-date estimates \\nof the number of people living with these conditions \\nwill remain essential to understanding the demands \\non affected families, health systems, social and health \\nsafety nets, and, of course, the people living with these \\nconditions. When biomarker-based prevalence estimates \\nbecome available, Facts and Figures  will also report the \\nestimated prevalence of individuals with any clinical \\ncognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease to reflect \\nboth those in the dementia phase and those in the MCI \\nphase of Alzheimer’s. Facts and Figures  will not include \\nprevalence estimates of the preclinical Alzheimer’s \\ndisease stage until (1) there is convincing evidence of a \\nconnection between biomarkers in this silent stage and \\nthe development of MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease and \\n(2) epidemiologic studies have estimated the number \\nof individuals in this stage. In addition, as the evidence \\nand epidemiological data warrant, future reports may \\nalso include estimates of the prevalence of dementia \\nfrom all causes. It should be noted that both symptom-\\nbased prevalence estimates of Alzheimer’s dementia and \\nbiomarker-based prevalence estimates of Alzheimer’s \\ndisease are expected to increase in the future due to \\ngrowth in the population of Americans age 65 and older, \\nthe group most at risk for developing cognitive symptoms.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 35, 'page_label': '34'}, page_content='34\\nAlzheimer’s Association. 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.

For example, the \\nneurologic effects of COVID-19 465 and the pandemic’s \\ndisruptions to general and brain-related health care \\nmay increase the incidence of Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias.

On the other \\nhand, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia could be influenced in the opposite direction \\nby increased mortality due to COVID-19 and other \\ncauses of death during the height of the pandemic, \\nwhich may have resulted in death prior to the onset of \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, or death with fewer years lived \\nwith Alzheimer’s dementia.\\n466 \\nLooking to the Future\\nContinued Population Aging\\nBy 2030, the segment of the U.S. population age 65 and \\nolder will have grown substantially, and the projected  \\n71 million older Americans will make up over 20% of the \\ntotal population (up from 17% in 2022).\\n289 Additionally, \\nthe size of the older adult population is expected to \\ncontinue to increase relative to the population age 64 \\nand younger — a shift known as population aging — \\ndue to a projected decline in fertility, as well as to \\nincreased survival at older ages. Fertility, the average \\nnumber of children per woman, has decreased since \\n1960 in the United States.\\n467 With fewer babies born \\neach year, older adults will make up a larger proportion \\nof the population. Because increasing age is the \\npredominant risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia,  \\nas the number and proportion of older Americans  \\ngrows rapidly, so too will the numbers of new and existing \\ncases of Alzheimer’s dementia, as shown in Figure 7.\\nA5, 293 \\nBy 2060, the number of people age 65 and older with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia is projected to reach 13.8 million, \\nbarring the development of breakthroughs to prevent or \\ncure Alzheimer’s disease.\\nA5, 293\\nGrowth of the Age 85 and Older Population\\nThe number of Americans in their 80s, 90s and beyond \\nis expected to grow dramatically due to population \\naging.\\n289 This will lead to an increase in the number and \\npercentage of Americans 85 and older. This age group is \\nexpected to comprise 11% of the population age 65 and \\nolder in 2025 and 21% of the population age 65 and \\nolder in 2050.\\n468 This will result in an additional  \\n10 million people age 85 and older — individuals at the \\nhighest risk for developing Alzheimer’s dementia. 468\\n• In 2025, about 2.5 million people living with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia are expected to be age 85 or older, accounting \\nfor 33% of all people with Alzheimer’s dementia.293\\n• By 2060, 6.7 million people age 85 and older are \\nexpected to have Alzheimer’s dementia, accounting \\nfor about half (48%) of all people 65 and older with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia.293\\nIncreased Diversity of Older Adults  \\nThe group of older adults who will be at risk for \\nAlzheimer’s in the coming years will be socially, \\nculturally and economically different from previous \\ngroups of older U.S. adults. For example, between 2018 \\nand 2040, projections for older adults show increases \\nin the American Indian population of 75%, in the Black \\npopulation of 88%, in the Asian population of 113% and \\nin the Hispanic population of 175% compared with an \\nincrease of 32% in the White population.\\n469\\nIn addition, in the coming decades women age 65 and \\nolder will be among the first generations of women \\nto have widely worked outside the home, and they will \\nhave more years of formal education than previous \\ngenerations of women.\\n470 In parallel these generations \\nof women came of age during a decrease in the birth \\nrate, resulting in smaller family size. 471 Whether and \\nhow these social and economic experiences influence \\nwomen’s risk of and resilience to Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementia will become clearer in the decades ahead.\\nSince the 1970s, the gaps in income and net wealth, \\nthe value of an owned home, retirement accounts, \\nand pensions minus debt, in the U.S. between lower-\\nincome, middle-income, and upper-income households \\nhas been widening.\\n472, 473 This means that the many \\npeople who are age 65 and older experienced their \\nadulthood during this trend, which may have influenced \\nhealth and health behaviors prior to age 65. In older \\nadulthood, income and net wealth inequality may have \\nimplications for health care, health behaviors and social \\ndeterminants of health that influence Alzheimer’s risk, \\nparticularly in low-income households.\\nGiven the different life experiences of future older \\nadult populations, it is unclear what the accompanying \\nchanges will be to dementia incidence and prevalence, \\nboth at the population level and within racial/ethnic, \\nsocioeconomic, and sex and gender groups. A birth \\ncohort perspective, which considers how a certain \\ngroup of people has passed through different stages of \\nlife in particular years, will be increasingly important for \\nunderstanding factors of risk and resilience that may \\nbe unique to the groups of people at highest risk for \\ndementia in the coming decades.\\n447, 474, 475'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 42, 'page_label': '41'}, page_content=\"MORTALITY  \\nAND MORBIDITY  \\nAmong people aged 70, \\n61% of those with Alzheimer's \\ndementia are expected to die \\nbefore age 80 compared  \\nwith 30% of people without\\nAlzheimer's dementia.\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 43, 'page_label': '42'}, page_content='Alzheimer’s disease was the sixth-leading cause of death \\namong individuals age 65 and older in 2022. 476 Alzheimer’s \\ndisease may cause even more deaths than official sources \\nrecognize.

Scientists have developed \\nmeasures that compare the burden of different diseases on \\na population in a way that takes into account not only the \\nnumber of people with the condition, but also the number \\nof years of life lost due to that disease and the number of \\nhealthy years of life lost by virtue of being in a state of \\ndisability. One measure of disease burden is called disability-\\nadjusted life years (DALYs), which is a combination of the \\nnumber of years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature \\nmortality and the number of years lived with disability \\n(YLDs), totaled across all those with the disease or injury. \\nThese measures indicate that Alzheimer’s is a very \\nburdensome disease, not only to the individuals with the \\ndisease, but also to their families, informal caregivers and \\ncommunities at large. In recent years, the burden of \\nAlzheimer’s has increased more dramatically in the United \\nStates than the burden of other diseases. According to the \\nmost recent Global Burden of Disease classification system, \\nAlzheimer’s disease rose from the 12th most burdensome \\ndisease or injury in the United States in 1990 to the sixth \\nin 2016 in terms of DALYs.\\n477 In 2016, Alzheimer’s disease \\nwas the fourth highest disease or injury in terms of YLLs \\nand the 19th in terms of YLDs.\\n477  \\nThese disability estimates are based on data across  \\nU.S. states and should be interpreted with consideration \\nof the comparability of data across time 495 and how \\ndisability is incorporated. The Alzheimer’s burden \\nestimates use different sources for each state in a given \\nyear, and data sources for states may differ over the years. \\nEstimates do not account for the context in which \\ndisability is experienced, including social support, attitudes \\nand economic and social resources, which may vary widely \\nboth across and within countries.\\n496-498 Estimates may not \\nfully account for variation in disability levels between \\nindividuals and along the stages of Alzheimer’s dementia. \\nThese variations in data sources and consideration of \\ndisability may limit the value of these metrics and the \\ncomparability of estimates across states and across years.\\nLooking to the Future\\nTaken together, these statistics indicate that not only is \\nAlzheimer’s disease responsible for the deaths of more  \\nand more Americans, but also that Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias are contributing to more and more cases of poor \\nhealth and disability in the U.S. With the population aging, \\nthe percentage of deaths from Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias will likely continue to increase. The health and \\nwell-being of people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias \\nshould continue to be prioritized. Thus, it will remain \\nimportant to develop a comprehensive understanding of \\nhow Alzheimer’s and other dementias contribute to poor \\nhealth, disability and mortality. That understanding requires \\ninnovation in research methods that are more inclusive and \\nthat fully capture the lived experience of disability of people \\nliving with dementia and of their families and caregivers.\\nCreated from data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 476\\nTABLE 7\\nU.S. Annual Alzheimer’s Death Rates (per 100,000 People) by Age and Year\\nAge 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022\\n45-54 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3\\n55-64 2.0 1.9 1.8 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.7 2.9 3.3 3.5\\n65-74 18.7 19.6 19.5 19.9 21.1 19.8 17.9 19.6 23.6 24.7 28.6 26.7\\n75-84 139.6 157.7 168.5 175.0 192.5 184.5 175.4 185.6 214.1 213.9 229.3 206.2\\n85+ 667.7 790.9 875.3 923.4 1,002.2 987.1 936.1 1,006.8 1,216.9 1,225.3 1,287.3 1,131.5'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 49, 'page_label': '48'}, page_content='CAREGIVING\\nNearly 12 million Americans  \\nprovide unpaid care for a family \\nmember or friend with dementia,  \\na contribution to the nation valued \\nat more than $413 billion.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 50, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='49Caregiving\\nUnpaid Caregivers\\nEighty-three percent of the help provided to older adults  \\nin the United States comes from family members, friends \\nor other unpaid caregivers.501 Nearly half of all unpaid \\ncaregivers (48%) who provide help to older adults do so for \\nsomeone with Alzheimer’s or another dementia.\\n502 More \\nthan 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for people \\nwith Alzheimer’s or other dementias.\\nA7 Table 9 provides \\ndetails about unpaid caregivers.\\nIn 2024, caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s or other \\ndementias provided an estimated 19.2 billion hoursA8 of \\ninformal — that is, unpaid — assistance, a contribution \\nvalued at $413.5 billion.\\nA9 This is approximately 64% of the \\nnet value of Walmart’s total revenue in fiscal year 2024 \\n($648.1 billion)\\n503 and nearly 16 times the total revenue of \\nMcDonald’s in 2023 ($25.9 billion).504 The total lifetime cost \\nof care for someone with dementia was estimated at \\n$405,262 in 2024 dollars.\\n505 Seventy percent of this \\nlifetime cost of care is borne by family caregivers in the \\nforms of unpaid caregiving and out-of-pocket expenses  \\nCaregiving refers to attending to another \\nperson’s health needs and well-being. \\nWhen supporting a person living with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, caregiving often \\nincludes assistance with one or more \\nactivities of daily living (ADLs), such as \\nbathing and dressing, as well as multiple \\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), \\nsuch as paying bills, shopping and using \\ntransportation.\\n499, 500 Caregivers also provide \\nemotional support to people with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, help them manage \\nhealth conditions, and communicate and \\ncoordinate care with other family members \\nand health care providers (see Table 8).

Specific \\napproaches used in various interventions include \\nproviding education to caregivers, helping caregivers \\nmanage dementia-related symptoms, improving social \\nsupport for caregivers and providing caregivers with \\nrespite from caregiving duties.\\nThe following characteristics distinguish interventions \\nthat are effective: family caregivers are actively involved \\nin the intervention, in contrast to passively receiving \\ninformation; the intervention is tailored and flexible to \\nmeet the changing needs of family caregivers during the \\ncourse of a relative’s dementia; and the intervention \\nmeets the needs not only of caregivers but of people \\nliving with dementia as well.\\n681 A meta-analysis examining \\nthe components of dementia caregiver interventions  \\nthat are most beneficial found that interventions that \\ninitially enhance caregiving competency, gradually address \\nthe care needs of the person with dementia, and offer \\nemotional support for loss and grief when needed \\nappeared most effective.\\n682 A prior report examined \\nrandomized, controlled studies of caregiver interventions \\nand identified 44 interventions that benefited individuals \\nwith dementia as well as caregivers, and more such \\ninterventions are emerging each year.\\n683-688 Although \\nseveral national reports have suggested that the available \\nscientific evidence does not provide clear suggestions as \\nto which intervention types benefit dementia caregivers \\nconsistently,\\n689 other meta-analyses report that  \\nspecific intervention types (such as psychoeducation;  \\nsee Table 13) may result in a small reduction in  \\nburden for caregivers, with other meta-analyses \\nindicating broader effects of various interventions  \\nacross multiple dementia caregiver outcomes.\\n679, 690-694  \\nA meta-review of over 60 meta-analyses and systematic \\nreviews of dementia caregiver interventions indicate  \\nthat although various interventions may have positive \\neffects on depression and other measures of caregiver \\nwell-being, challenges related to how interventions are \\nreported and classified has made it difficult to ascertain \\nwhat works and why for dementia caregivers.\\n695\\nType Focus\\nCase management Provides assessment, information, planning, referral, care coordination and/or advocacy for  \\nfamily caregivers.\\nPsychoeducational \\napproaches\\nInclude structured programs that provide information about the disease, resources and services, and about \\nhow to expand skills to effectively respond to symptoms of the disease (for example, cognitive impairment, \\nbehavioral symptoms and care-related needs). Include lectures, discussions and written materials and are led \\nby professionals with specialized training.\\nCounseling Aims to resolve preexisting personal problems that complicate caregiving to reduce conflicts between \\ncaregivers and care recipients and/or improve family functioning.\\nPsychotherapeutic \\napproaches\\nInvolve the establishment of a therapeutic relationship between the caregiver and a professional therapist \\n(for example, cognitive behavioral therapy for caregivers to focus on identifying and modifying beliefs \\nrelated to emotional distress, developing new behaviors to deal with caregiving demands, and fostering \\nactivities that can promote caregiver well-being).\\nRespite Provides planned, temporary relief for the caregiver through the provision of substitute care; examples \\ninclude adult day services and in-home or institutional respite care for a certain number of weekly hours.\\nSupport groups Are less structured than psychoeducational or psychotherapeutic interventions.

Compared with \\ndementia caregivers in 1999, dementia caregivers in \\n2015 were significantly less likely to report physical \\ndifficulties (from 30% in 1999 to 17% in 2015) and \\nfinancial difficulties (from 22% in 1999 to 9% in 2015) \\nrelated to care provision.

A study of the Older \\nAmericans Act’s National Family Caregiver Support \\nProgram found that over half (52%) of Area Agencies on \\nAging did not offer evidence-based family caregiver \\ninterventions.\\n744 In addition, there is some indication \\nthat the number of family members available to provide \\ncare to older relatives with health needs is likely to \\ndecrease due to a range of sociodemographic and \\nhealth trends in the U.S. (e.g., the aging of the U.S. \\npopulation, a lower birth rate and adult children’s \\ngeographic mobility/dispersion over the prior several \\ndecades).\\n745 The need to bridge this impending “family \\ncare gap” and other dementia caregiving challenges and \\nconcerns through new policies, services and research is \\na growing public health concern. 737, 746\\nA National Strategy to Support  \\nFamily Caregivers\\nThe Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage \\n(RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, which was signed into law \\nin January 2018, authorized the U.S. Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services to develop the first national \\nstrategy to support family caregivers. To advance the \\ndevelopment of this strategy, a 30-member Family \\nCaregiving Advisory Council was established to provide \\nkey recommendations, guidance and best practices that \\nsupport family caregivers. In September 2022 the \\nAdvisory Council delivered its National Strategy to \\nSupport Family Caregivers to Congress. It features \\nnearly 350 actions that 15 federal agencies will adopt \\nand 150 actions that states, communities and others can \\ntake. The four core principles that drive these many \\nsupportive actions include: 1) placing the family and \\nperson at the center of all interactions; 2) addressing \\ntrauma and its impact on families; 3) advancing equity, \\naccessibility and inclusion for family caregivers in \\nunderserved communities; and 4) elevating direct care \\nworkers as family caregiving partners.\\n782 In a 2024 \\nprogress report, almost all of the 350 federal actions \\nrecommended in the 2022 National Strategy are \\nimplemented or in process to support family caregivers. \\nThis includes $20 million in funding to support the \\nstrategy's implementation and federal guidance to states \\nso that new or updated state plans on aging align with the \\nNational Strategy's recommendations.\\n783\\nOn July 1, 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \\nServices (CMS) launched the Guiding an Improved \\nDementia Experience (GUIDE) Model. Three-hundred \\nand ninety organizations are participating as GUIDE \\nModel sites across the U.S. The GUIDE Model features \\nthe provision of comprehensive dementia care \\ncoordination and management, caregiver education and \\nsupport, and respite services. Individuals living with \\ndementia and their caregivers will also have access to a \\n24/7 support line. The GUIDE Model is unique in that it \\nincentivizes providers to incorporate both the person \\nwith dementia and  the caregiver (or caregivers) into the \\ncollaborative, multidisciplinary service approach. Critically, \\nCMS will include policies to ensure that underserved \\ncommunities have equal access to GUIDE Model services \\nto address disparities in access to and quality of dementia \\ncare (see the Workforce section, page 74, for more \\ninformation about the GUIDE Model).\\n784\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 65, 'page_label': '64'}, page_content='WORKFORCE  \\nNearly 900,000 additional  \\ndirect care workers will be \\nneeded between 2022 and 2032 \\n — more new workers than in \\nany other single occupation  \\nin the United States.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 66, 'page_label': '65'}, page_content='Workforce 65\\nAs the prevalence of Alzheimer’s and \\nother dementias increases, so does the \\nneed for more members of the paid \\nworkforce to be knowledgeable about and \\nskillful in working with diverse populations \\nliving with these conditions as well as  \\nwith their families.\\n785, 786 A collaborative, \\nmultidisciplinary dementia-capable \\nworkforce is needed to cover the full \\nspectrum of health and social care for \\npeople living across the disease continuum \\n— from identifying a cognitive or \\nmemory concern, through screening for \\nand diagnosing its cause, to treating it, \\nmonitoring its progression and providing \\nhands-on care for those affected.  \\nThis multidisciplinary workforce includes, but is not  \\nlimited to, primary care providers (PCPs), including \\nphysicians and advanced practice clinicians; specialists \\nsuch as geriatricians, neurologists and psychiatrists;  \\nother licensed providers, such as registered nurses, \\npsychologists, therapists and social workers; members of \\nthe direct care workforce, including personal care aides, \\nhome health aides and nursing assistants; and the broader \\ncommunity-based workforce that interacts with the \\npublic, including community health workers as well as \\nnon-medical professionals such as police officers, bank \\ntellers, librarians, hairdressers, bus drivers, attorneys,  \\nfaith leaders and others. \\nEach of these professionals plays a crucial role in \\naddressing the diverse needs of people living with \\nAlzheimer’s disease and other dementias and their families. \\nHowever, the current siloed approach to dementia \\ndiagnosis and management often leads to fragmented care \\nand missed opportunities for early intervention and \\nongoing support.

These professionals offer nursing, rehabilitation \\nand supportive services across community settings, skilled \\nnursing homes and other locations. Their services \\nencompass medication administration, intravenous \\ninjections, wound and catheter care, physical and \\noccupational therapy, behavioral consultation and more. \\nAdditionally, nurses and social workers most often provide \\ncare navigation, coordination and management services, \\nand licensed clinical social workers and psychologists may \\nprovide therapeutic services to people living with dementia \\nand their caregivers.\\nSpecialization in caring for older adults, however, remains \\nlimited across these occupational groups. For instance,  \\na survey of Master of Social Work graduates from 2017  \\nto 2019 revealed that only 4.2% specialized in aging or \\ngerontology.\\n832 Nonetheless, 20% to 48% of social  \\nwork students expressed high interest in working with \\nolder adults.833-837 This discrepancy may be due to the \\nprofession’s broad scope, which may direct student interest \\ntoward social issues rather than age-specific populations.\\n838 \\nThe largest segment of the workforce that supports people \\nliving with dementia is the direct care workforce.839 Direct \\ncare workers — who are formally classified as personal \\ncare aides, home health aides and nursing assistants, but \\nknown by a wide range of job titles in the field — assist \\nolder adults and people with disabilities in private homes, \\ncommunity-based settings such as adult day services and \\nresidential care, skilled nursing homes and other settings \\nsuch as hospitals.\\n840 Across these settings, direct care \\nworkers deliver the majority of day-to-day care to patients, \\nclients or residents living with Alzheimer’s disease and \\nother forms of dementia. \\nDirect care workers provide assistance with activities  \\nof daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, eating, toilet care \\nand mobility. In home care settings, they also support \\nindividuals with household chores, meal preparation, \\nattending appointments and other instrumental activities \\nof daily living (IADLs). Under the supervision of licensed \\nnurses or other health care professionals, home health \\naides and nursing assistants also perform certain  \\nclinical tasks, such as wound care, vital signs and \\nmedication administration (depending on the setting  \\nand regulatory context).\\n841, 842\\nBeyond these distinct tasks, direct care workers play a \\nbroader role in promoting nutrition, exercise, functional \\nability, social engagement and emotional well-being for \\nthose living with dementia. With training in active listening, \\nempathic response and other relevant skills, direct care \\nworkers can reduce social isolation and provide emotional \\nsupport and, with additional training, help prevent or \\nreduce distress associated with dementia through the \\ndelivery of person-centered, non-pharmacological \\ninterventions.\\n843-846  \\nDirect care workers also support quality outcomes and,  \\nas a result, cost savings. Direct care workers providing \\nin-home care enable individuals to continue living at home \\nand help prevent or delay nursing home placement.847 \\nAcross settings, they also provide care to individuals \\nreturning from a hospital stay and can help reduce the risk \\nof readmission, as well as assist with end-of-life care \\ntransitions.\\n848-851 Thanks to their daily caregiving role, \\ndirect care workers are well placed to observe and report \\nchanges of status to clinical colleagues, thereby helping to \\nreduce the risk of emergency department visits, avoidable \\nhospitalizations and other adverse outcomes that are \\ndisproportionately high among people living with \\ndementia.\\n852, 853 Research suggests that with enhanced \\ndementia-specific training, direct care workers may also \\nplay a role in implementing non-pharmacological \\ninterventions,854 as noted above, and reducing \\ninappropriate antipsychotic prescribing for individuals  \\nliving with dementia in nursing homes.855\\nBetween 2014 and 2023, the number of direct care workers \\nincreased from 3.5 million to 5 million due to growing \\ndemand for long-term care.\\n840 Looking ahead, researchers \\nhave estimated that just over 861,000 additional direct care \\nworkers will be needed between 2022 and 2032 — more \\nnew workers than in any other single occupation in the \\nUnited States.\\n840 Growth in job opportunities is occurring \\nprimarily among personal care aides and home health aides, \\nreflecting the overwhelming preference for “aging in place” \\nand public policies that have expanded access to home and \\ncommunity-based services.\\n856\\nThis projected growth in the direct care workforce — \\nwhich is estimated from previous workforce growth rates \\ndriven by increasing demand — is expected across the \\ncountry. As shown in Table 15, in every state except Maine, \\nbetween 2022 and 2032, double-digit percentage \\nincreases have been predicted in the number of needed \\nhome health and personal care aides.

Turnover rates are high in \\nthis workforce — with an estimated median rate of 80% \\nannually for direct care workers providing home care\\n858 \\nand 99% for nursing assistants in nursing homes859 —  \\nand recruitment and retention are long-standing \\nchallenges.860-862 In turn, instability in the workforce and \\nunderstaffing across care settings can lead to stress, injury \\nand burnout among direct care workers, thereby further \\ncontributing to turnover while also compromising care \\naccess and quality.\\n863, 864\\nWorkforce challenges are driven by persistently low \\ncompensation and poor job conditions for direct care \\nworkers, which are in turn underpinned by structural racial \\nand gender inequities (that marginalize this workforce \\ncomposed predominantly of women and people of color),\\n840 \\nas well as ageism and disablism (impacting the individuals \\nreceiving care and, by extension, those providing it).865 In \\n2023, the year for which the most recent national data are \\navailable, the median wage for direct care workers was \\n$16.72 per hour.\\n840 Despite their complex and critical role \\nin supporting the health and well-being of older adults and \\npeople with disabilities, direct care workers earned a lower \\nmedian wage than workers in other occupations with \\nsimilar or lower entry-level requirements, such as janitors, \\nretail salespeople and customer service representatives.\\n866 \\nFurthermore, due to low wages and the high prevalence of \\npart-time positions, the median annual earnings of direct \\ncare workers is approximately $25,000.\\n840\\nDirect care workers also receive limited training and \\nprofessional development opportunities, another \\nindicator of poor job conditions. Nursing assistants in \\nvarious care settings and home health aides employed  \\nby Medicare-certified home health agencies are required \\nby federal regulations to complete at least 75 hours of \\nentry-level training and 12 hours of annual continuing \\neducation (although many states have set higher training \\nrequirements).\\n862 Care for individuals with cognitive \\nimpairment is among the requisite training topics for \\nnursing assistants, but not for home health aides. In \\ncontrast, training requirements for other direct care \\nworkers — including those working in private homes, \\nassisted living communities, adult day services and other \\nsettings — vary by state and setting. With regard to \\ndementia-specific training, a 2015 review found that  \\nonly 13 states had established dementia care training \\nrequirements for direct care workers who provide \\nin-home care. According to the same review, 44 states \\nand the District of Columbia had set dementia care \\ntraining standards for assisted living staff, but those \\nregulations only pertained to special dementia care \\nfacilities or units in 14 of those states.\\n867 Inadequate \\ntraining for direct care workers perpetuates their \\nmischaracterization as “low-skill” workers, fails to prepare \\nthem for the complexity and challenges of their role, \\nundermines job satisfaction and retention, and directly \\nimpacts the provision of dementia care.   \\nDirect care is also physically and emotionally demanding \\nwork, which is not well-reflected in the training standards \\nor compensation for this workforce. As one indicator, \\noccupational injury data from the Bureau of Labor \\nStatistics show that nursing assistants in nursing homes \\nwere nearly five times more likely than U.S. workers overall \\nto experience workplace injuries in 2022 (the most recent \\nyear for which occupation-specific data on injuries in \\nnursing homes were available).\\n840 These data reflect the \\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this workforce —  \\nas COVID-19 was classified as a “workplace injury”868 —  \\nas well as long-standing occupational risks.869 Comparable \\noccupational injury data are not available for direct care \\nworkers in home and community-based settings due to \\nreporting limitations, but these workers are also exposed \\nto a range of occupational risks, including unsafe physical \\nenvironments, infection hazards, interpersonal violence \\nand more.\\n870 \\nThe Community-Based Workforce\\n“Dementia-friendly communities” are environments and \\nhealth and social systems that are designed to support \\npeople with dementia to live and age in place, thereby \\npreventing or delaying admission into nursing homes and \\nother congregate care settings.\\n871, 872 Work on dementia-\\nfriendly communities began in Japan as early as 2004, with \\na nationwide campaign to better understand dementia  \\nand build supportive community networks, which inspired \\ngrowth of the movement worldwide.\\n873 In the U.S., the \\nDementia-Friendly America (DFA) initiative launched  \\nin 2015 and was described as a first-of-its-kind national \\neffort that was announced at the White House Conference \\non Aging.\\n874 DFA was built on the leadership of ACT on \\nAlzheimer’s, a community-led initiative in Minnesota that \\nbegan in 2013.875 \\nEssential to dementia-friendly communities is a \\ncommunity-based workforce that holds sufficient \\ndementia-related knowledge, skills and competencies.

One recent global scoping review found five  \\nbroad areas for the potential role of CHWs in addressing \\ndementia: education and awareness-building; screening  \\nfor dementia; screening for HIV-associated dementia; \\nassistance with utilizing health care resources; and services \\nto dementia caregivers.\\n886\\nCollaborative Workforce Models for  \\nDementia Care\\nA major barrier to improving dementia care is fragmentation \\nof care delivery, which occurs when patients receive care \\nfrom many providers, but no single provider accounts for a \\nsubstantial proportion of visits.\\n887 Although seeing multiple \\nproviders may be clinically appropriate, providers do not \\noften communicate or coordinate with each other in the \\ncare of their common patients. Gaps in coordinated care are \\ncommon and can increase the risk of medical errors and \\nsuboptimal care.\\n888-893\\nSeveral decades of research supports the value of \\ncollaborative, primary care-based models that bring \\ntogether different members of the health care and \\ncommunity-based workforces to care for people and their \\ncaregivers across the Alzheimer’s disease continuum.\\n894, 895 \\nThese collaborative models have been associated with a \\nrange of benefits, including reduced behavioral symptoms, \\nimproved function and quality of life, decreased caregiver \\nburden, and lower health care costs related to \\nhospitalizations, emergency department visits and other \\noutpatient visits.\\n895-897\\nAs one example of collaborative dementia care, the \\nAlzheimer’s and Dementia Care Program is a health \\nsystems-based model in which nurse practitioners with \\nextensive training in dementia care, known as dementia  \\ncare specialists (DCSs), co-manage care with PCPs and \\ncommunity-based partners. DCSs provide comprehensive \\ncare addressing medical, behavioral and social aspects of \\ndementia through the development of care plans tailored to \\nthe needs and goals of each patient living with dementia and \\ntheir caregiver. In this co-management model, the PCP is \\nresponsible for the patient’s primary care needs but shares \\nresponsibility for the dementia-related aspects of care with \\nthe DCS, including reviewing and providing input on the \\ndementia care plan. The care plan is then implemented by a \\nteam, led by the DCS, that includes family members, other \\nhealth professionals and community-based organizations.\\n714 \\nThis model has been found to reduce nursing home \\nadmissions for participating Medicare beneficiaries.898 In a \\nquasi-experimental study of 3,249 patients with dementia \\nfrom 2012 through 2015, the program was associated with \\n$601 lower costs of health care per patient per quarter \\n($2,404 per year), while the cost of running the program \\nwas $317 per patient per quarter ($1,268 per year). This \\ntranslated to a net savings to Medicare of $284 per patient \\nper quarter ($1,136 per year).\\n898\\nThe Gerontological Society of America’s Kickstart, Assess, \\nEvaluate, Refer (KAER) model provides another example of \\ncollaborative approaches to better detect and manage \\ndementia.\\n899 Among other strategies, this model leverages \\nthe role of non-clinical office staff as part of the primary \\ncare team.

Complementing this \\ntraining, language-concordant and culturally tailored \\nresources and referrals are needed to help overcome the \\nmisunderstandings, biases, misdiagnoses and related \\ndisparities experienced by people of color and other \\nindividuals in minority populations who are living with \\ndementia and by their families.\\n918-923\\nA number of efforts are underway to build the health care \\nworkforce that is needed to support the growing older \\npopulation and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other \\ndementias in particular. One key example is the Geriatrics \\nWorkforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) funded by the \\nHealth Resources and Services Administration, which \\ncomprises a network of 42 individual GWEPs across 37  \\nU.S. states.\\n924 The goals of this program are to educate and \\ntrain the health care workforce to provide care for older \\nadults in a way that integrates geriatrics and primary care, \\nand to deliver community-based programs that improve \\nhealth outcomes for older adults. One particular goal for the \\nGWEPs is to provide dementia training to a broad range of \\nhealth care professionals, educators, individuals and families. \\nAdditional innovative workforce expansion approaches \\ninclude flexible geriatric medicine fellowship training for \\nmid-career physicians, the pilot of a Medicine-Geriatrics \\nIntegrated Residency and Fellowship Pathway (Med-Geri \\nPathway), and a combined Geriatrics & Palliative Medicine \\n(Geri-Pal) Fellowship. \\nOne specific training model is the Alzheimer’s and Dementia \\nCare ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare \\nOutcomes) Program, which pairs PCPs with multidisciplinary \\nspecialist teams through telementoring to develop PCPs' \\nknowledge and confidence in dementia care.

For \\nexample, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently \\napproved two drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s that \\nare delivered through intravenous infusion and require \\ncareful monitoring of patients for a serious potential side \\neffect called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA \\n(see “Treatments to Slow Alzheimer’s Disease,” page 14).\\n57, 60 \\nEnsuring the health of individuals while they receive these \\ndrugs requires an expanded workforce including infusion \\nnurses, radiologists and radiology technicians with special \\ntraining in recognizing ARIA, and specialists with expertise in \\nmanaging ARIA if it occurs. Neuropsychologists and other \\nhealth care professionals are also needed to evaluate \\nwhether individuals are benefiting from the treatments, as \\nthose who do not experience improvements in cognitive \\nskills and the ability to perform ADLs may be advised to \\ndiscontinue treatment.\\nOf note, in 2023 the National Institute on Aging funded the \\nNational Dementia Workforce Study (NDWS) under the \\nleadership of a team of experts in survey research, health \\nworkforce research and clinical care of people living with \\ndementia. The NDWS is building a data infrastructure to \\ninform efforts to strengthen the workforce of clinicians and \\nother care providers required by the growing population of \\npeople living with dementia in the United States.\\n926 The first \\nyear of data from the NDWS surveys is anticipated in  \\nspring 2025.\\nPayment Models to Support the Dementia  \\nCare Workforce \\nAlternative payment models may be needed to scale up the \\ndelivery of collaborative, comprehensive and innovative \\ndementia care.897, 927, 928 One development in this area, as \\ndescribed earlier, is that since 2017 Medicare has reimbursed \\nphysicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and \\nnurse specialists for health care visits that result in a \\ncomprehensive dementia care plan. (As of January 1, 2024, \\nMedicare reimbursed approximately $268 to physicians and \\nother eligible billing practitioners, through billing code \\n99483, for providing a comprehensive clinical visit that \\nresulted in a written care plan; the rate may be \\ngeographically adjusted.\\n795, 929, 930) However, as noted, use  \\nof this benefit has been limited, likely because providers, \\nespecially in smaller practices and rural areas, are \\ninsufficiently aware of the appropriate billing codes, and/or \\nmay be billing for similar services under different codes.797, 931 \\nIn the future, providers could be better informed about \\nthese codes. Dementia Care Aware is one example of a \\nstatewide program in California that proactively provides \\nPCPs with information and tools to successfully administer \\ncognitive health assessments and determine appropriate \\nnext steps for patients, as well as to use the correct \\nprocedural terminology codes for billing.\\n932, 933 Furthermore, \\nthe codes could be revised to include other professionals \\nsuch as social workers and psychologists as billing entities.\\nAnother development in the area of payment models is the \\nnationwide voluntary GUIDE Model, announced by the \\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2023.\\n784 \\nThrough the GUIDE Model, participating organizations will \\noffer dementia care programs that provide ongoing, \\ninterdisciplinary care and support for community-dwelling \\nMedicare fee-for-service beneficiaries living with dementia, \\nas well as their caregivers. Each interdisciplinary GUIDE \\nteam must include a knowledgeable and skilled care \\nnavigator to help individuals access clinical and non-clinical \\nservices and supports, such as person-centered \\nassessments and care plans, care coordination, caregiver \\ntraining and education, meals and transportation through \\ncommunity-based organizations, and 24/7 support.  \\nCMS is testing an alternative payment for participating \\norganizations, which must be Medicare Part B–enrolled \\nproviders/suppliers and eligible to bill for Medicare \\nPhysician Fee Schedule services. To address inequities in \\ndementia care, CMS is actively seeking safety-net \\norganizations that provide care to underserved \\ncommunities, including disproportionately Black/African \\nAmerican and Hispanic communities, to participate in the \\nGUIDE Model. For these organizations, CMS will provide \\nfinancial and technical supports to ensure they can develop \\ntheir infrastructure, improve their workforce and care \\ndelivery capabilities, and participate successfully.\\n784\\nFinancing and other public policy reforms are also needed  \\nto strengthen and stabilize the direct care workforce. In \\nrecent years, the federal government and states have taken \\nunprecedented action to improve job quality and bolster \\nthis workforce, particularly through Medicaid. These \\nactions have included but are not limited to overhauling \\ntraining and credentialing systems, designing new career \\ndevelopment opportunities, implementing reimbursement \\nrate increases tied to increased compensation, and \\ndeveloping new recruitment campaigns and pipeline \\nprograms.\\n934, 935 The challenge will be to sustain these \\ninvestments into the future, as the need for direct care \\nservices continues to escalate.'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 76, 'page_label': '75'}, page_content='75Workforce\\nTechnology to Augment Dementia Care Delivery\\nMajor advances in technology are optimizing the time and \\neffectiveness of the dementia care workforce.

The main purpose of hospice is to allow \\nindividuals to die with dignity and without pain and other \\ndistressing symptoms that often accompany terminal \\nillness. Medicare is the primary source of payment for \\nhospice care, but private insurance, Medicaid and other \\nsources also pay for hospice care. Medicare beneficiaries \\nenrolled in Medicare Part A (i.e., Medicare’s hospital \\ninsurance) can choose to enroll in Medicare’s hospice \\nbenefit if a hospice physician certifies that the individual \\nis terminally ill (i.e., expected to live six months or less), \\nand the individual accepts palliative or comfort care and \\nforgoes curative care for the terminal illness. In this  \\nway, hospice care replaces other Medicare-covered \\nbenefits for treating the terminal illness and related \\nconditions.\\n1013 Medicare pays for nearly all costs of care \\nrelated to the terminal illness for individuals receiving \\nhospice care.

These assessments, coupled with Medicare \\npayment rates that are roughly 20% lower after the first \\n60 days, may contribute to disenrollment; however,  \\nmore research is needed to understand the implications  \\nof these policies for individuals with dementia in \\nhospice.\\n1020, 1021  \\nOverall, 12.2% of Medicare beneficiaries with \\nAlzheimer’s had at least one hospice claim in 2018, \\ncompared with 1.4% of Medicare beneficiaries without \\nthe disease, translating into per-person hospice \\npayments (for all beneficiaries, regardless of whether \\nthey used any hospice services) of $2,384 for individuals \\nwith Alzheimer’s compared with $140 for all other \\nMedicare beneficiaries.\\n941 In 2016, Medicare \\nreimbursement for home hospice services changed from \\na simple daily rate for each setting to a two-tiered \\napproach that provides higher reimbursement for days  \\n1 to 60 than for subsequent days.

They were tested in \\npeople with confirmed beta-amyloid accumulation in the \\nbrain who were living with MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease \\nor mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s. Several other \\ntreatments that target beta-amyloid accumulation and \\nother well-established brain changes of Alzheimer’s disease \\nare in late-stage development. These treatments are \\npromising for changing the course of the disease.\\nAlthough these treatments, and others on the horizon, \\nhave the potential to improve quality of life for millions of \\nadults and their families, there are some considerations. \\nFor example, while lecanemab demonstrated clinically \\nsignificant changes in cognition and function, in the \\nshort-term its effects may be imperceptible to those \\nbeing treated.\\n1051 Additionally, people who receive \\nlecanemab and donanemab are at risk of developing a \\nserious side effect known as ARIA — amyloid-related \\nimaging abnormalities with edema or effusions. Another \\nconcern is the affordability of treatment to both payers, \\nsuch as Medicare, and to individuals and their families, \\nwho may bear out-of-pocket costs due to deductibles, \\ncopayments and coinsurance.\\n1052 Additionally, the current \\nmarket price of treatment is high, at $26,500 per person \\nper year.1053, 1054 Lack of affordability of Medicare \\nsupplemental insurance is also likely to widen disparities in \\naccess to treatment for Medicare enrollees with low \\nincomes given these market prices.\\nFrom a societal perspective, the number of people eligible \\nfor and the total cost of these treatments is a potential \\nconcern. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \\ncovers the cost of the medications for Medicare \\nbeneficiaries diagnosed with MCI due to Alzheimer’s \\ndisease or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s dementia \\nwho have documented evidence of beta-amyloid \\naccumulation in the brain and whose physicians \\nparticipate in a qualifying patient registry with an \\nappropriate clinical team and follow-up care.\\n1055 According \\nto Medicare, beneficiaries with traditional Medicare will \\npay the standard 20% coinsurance of the Medicare-\\napproved amount once they meet their Part B deductible. \\nCosts may be different for people with Medicare \\nsupplemental coverage (such as a Medigap plan) or other \\nsecondary insurance, or those enrolled in a Medicare \\nAdvantage plan. Medicare advises beneficiaries to contact \\ntheir plan for more specific cost information.\\nAlthough lecanemab and donanemab are for individuals \\nwith MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease or mild dementia due \\nto Alzheimer’s disease, the actual number of people who \\nmay be eligible to receive the treatments is projected to be \\nmuch smaller due to strict eligibility criteria. One group of \\nresearchers applied the clinical trial eligibility criteria to a \\nsample of adults with dementia or MCI and a positive brain \\namyloid PET scan and found that only 8% of the sample \\nwould meet the lecanemab clinical trial inclusion and \\nexclusion criteria.\\n1056 \\nBefore the approval of lecanemab and donanemab,  \\nseveral groups of researchers had estimated the health  \\nand long-term care cost implications of hypothetical \\ninterventions that either slow the onset of dementia or \\nreduce the symptoms.\\n506, 1057-1059 One analysis assumed a \\ntreatment that delayed onset of Alzheimer’s by five years \\nwould reduce total health and long-term care spending for \\npeople with Alzheimer’s by 33%, including a 44% reduction \\nin out-of-pocket payments by 2050,\\n1057 and another study \\nprojected a 14% reduction in total health care spending for \\npeople age 70 and older with Alzheimer’s from a one-year \\ndelay, a 27% reduction from a three-year delay, and a 39% \\nreduction from a five-year delay by 2050.\\n1058 Beyond the \\nsingle-year costs, the study also found that a delay in onset \\nmay increase total lifetime per capita health care spending \\ndue to longer life associated with delaying the onset of \\ndementia, although the additional health care costs may be \\noffset by lower informal care costs. Finally, a third study \\nestimated that a treatment slowing the rate of functional \\ndecline among people with dementia by 10% would reduce \\ntotal average per-person lifetime costs by $3,880 in 2015 \\ndollars ($4,887 in 2024 dollars), while a treatment that \\nreduces the number of behavioral and psychological \\nsymptoms by 10% would reduce total average per-person \\nlifetime costs by $680 ($856 in 2024 dollars).\\n505 However, \\nthese studies did not take into account the current market \\nprice for FDA-approved drugs. \\nTherapies that change the course of the disease may not \\nbe the only way to reduce health and long-term care costs. \\nThe Alzheimer’s Association commissioned a study of the \\npotential cost savings of early diagnosis,\\n1059 assuming that \\n88% of individuals who will develop Alzheimer’s disease \\nwould be diagnosed in the MCI phase rather than the \\ndementia phase or not at all.

The survey \\nwas offered in both English and Spanish as an online or \\nphone survey. \\nSurvey results\\nAmericans Are Worried About Alzheimer’s Disease Despite \\nKnowing Little About It\\nWorry about developing Alzheimer’s disease is common. In \\nthe survey, more than 4 in 5 U.S. adults (83%) expressed \\nsome level of worry, with more than 1 in 10 (12%) \\nexpressing a lot of worry (Figure 19). Hispanic Americans \\nand those with a family history worried most about \\nAlzheimer’s disease (see box, Perspectives of Individuals \\nwith a Family History of Alzheimer's, page 112). Hispanic \\nAmericans reported significantly higher levels of worry \\nthan all other groups surveyed, with nearly 1 in 3 (29%) \\nsaying they had a lot of worry compared with 14% of Native \\nAmericans, 12% of Asian Americans, 13% of Black \\nAmericans and 9% of White Americans. \\nAlthough worry is prevalent, understanding of both \\nAlzheimer’s and other diseases that cause dementia \\nremains considerably limited. Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans \\n(16%) said they knew a lot about Alzheimer’s disease, and \\neven fewer said they knew much about MCI or other \\ndiseases that cause dementia (Figure 19). MCI due to \\nAlzheimer’s disease is the symptomatic precursor to \\nAlzheimer’s dementia. \\nThese findings echo those of the 2022 Alzheimer’s Disease \\nFacts and Figures Special Report, More Than Normal Aging: \\nUnderstanding Mild Cognitive Impairment, which surveyed \\nAmerican adults ages 18 and older about their awareness \\nNot very muchNothing at all Some A lot\\n100\\n80\\n60\\n40\\n20\\n0\\nAlzheimer’s\\ndisease\\nFrontotemporal\\ndementia (FTD)\\nMild cognitive\\nimpairment \\n(MCI) Mixed\\ndementia\\nVascular\\ndementia\\nLewy body\\ndementia\\nKnowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Conditions\\n50\\n40\\n30\\n20\\n10\\n0\\n12%\\n16%\\nNo worry\\nat all\\n25%\\nA moderate\\namount of worry\\n46%\\nA little\\nworry\\nA lot\\nof worry\\nWorry About Developing Alzheimer’s Disease\\nFIGURE  19\\n16%\\n26%\\n55%\\n27%\\n4%\\n16% 6%\\n37%\\n36%\\n31%\\n22% 19%\\n36%\\n17%\\n36%\\n16%\\n30%\\n37% 42% 41%\\n50%\\n5% 4% 4%5%\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 106, 'page_label': '105'}, page_content=\"105\\nof MCI.1064 That survey found that 42% of Americans  \\nhad some level of worry about developing MCI due to \\nAlzheimer’s disease, with 14% worrying “a lot.”1064 The  \\n2022 Special Report also found that knowledge of MCI  \\nwas limited.1064\\nMost U.S. Adults Want to Know Early If They Have \\nAlzheimer’s Disease\\nAmericans overwhelmingly viewed early diagnosis of \\nAlzheimer’s disease as important (99%), with 4 in 5 (79%) \\nindicating that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is very \\nimportant (Figure 20). \\nWhite Americans were less likely to say early diagnosis was \\nvery important (76%) versus Black Americans (91%), Native \\nAmericans (87%), Hispanic Americans (86%) and Asian \\nAmericans (80%).\\nStrong Preference for Diagnosis Before Noticeable \\nSymptoms or When Symptoms Are Minor\\nAmericans indicated a strong preference for diagnosis as \\nearly as possible. Half of Americans (50%) would want  \\nto know if they had Alzheimer’s disease even before \\nexperiencing symptoms, and 1 in 3 (29%) would want  \\nto know at the point where they are experiencing minor \\nsymptoms (Figure 21). Fewer survey participants said  \\nthat they wanted to know their diagnosis as symptoms \\nworsened — 11% when experiencing mild symptoms,  \\n3% when experiencing moderate symptoms and 2% when \\nsymptoms were severe. Only 5% said they would never \\nwant to know if they had Alzheimer's disease (Figure 21). \\nThis preference for the timing of diagnosis varied among \\ndifferent population groups. Black Americans most wanted \\nto know about Alzheimer’s disease at the earliest stage \\nbefore symptoms arise, especially when compared with \\nWhite Americans (58% versus 48%, respectively). Greater \\npercentages of Native and Hispanic Americans said they \\nwould never want to know compared with other groups (11% \\nand 13%, respectively, versus 1% of Asian Americans, 7% of \\nBlack Americans and 4% of White Americans). \\nAgain, these responses are consistent with the 2022 Special \\nReport, which found that 54% of Americans ages 18 and \\nolder would want to know they had Alzheimer’s disease at \\nthe MCI stage, and only 5% would never want to know their \\ndiagnosis.\\n1064 As with this year’s findings, very few people \\nwere interested in waiting until the severe stages of the \\ndisease to be diagnosed.1064 Taken together with current \\nfindings, the public sentiment appears to be “earlier is \\nbetter” when it comes to an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.\\nThe Public Values Cognitive Assessments and Is Aware of \\nDiagnostic Tests but Lacks Biomarker Test Knowledge\\nPreventive health care screenings and services — such as \\ncholesterol or cancer screening — become a more \\nfrequent part of recommended care as one ages and are \\nessential tools for risk assessment and identifying diseases \\nin their early stages. Most Americans (59%) believed \\ncognitive screening for Alzheimer’s or other dementia is \\nvery important, albeit less so than other preventive \\nservices and screenings (Figure 22).

Four in 5 \\nAmericans (80%) indicated they would ask for a simple \\nmedical test to detect Alzheimer’s rather than waiting  \\nfor a doctor to suggest it (Figure 23, right panel). Overall, \\ninterest in a simple medical test to detect Alzheimer’s \\ndisease remained strong across all populations  \\nsurveyed.\\nPr eparedness Tops Benefits, While Loss of Insurance \\nCoverage Is Noted as a Risk of Testing\\nAmericans cited feeling prepared as a reason to want  \\na simple Alzheimer’s test. Preparedness encompasses \\nallowing for earlier treatment and care, general planning  \\nfor the future, encouraging action to preserve cognitive \\nfunction for as long as possible, addressing safety issues in \\nadvance, and assembling medical and caregiving teams. \\nThe top reason for wanting a test to detect Alzheimer’s \\ndisease was that it would allow for earlier treatment and \\ncare (4 in 5 respondents, 83%). Three in 4 (76%) \\nrespondents said another reason is it would allow them to \\nbetter plan for the future with their family, and 2 in 3 (68%) \\nsaid it would encourage them to take actions that could \\nhelp preserve their cognitive function (Figure 24, top panel). \\nWanting education is also a reason for seeking testing. \\nAmericans said they would want a test because it could \\nhelp them understand what is happening (67%) and \\nencourage them to seek support and education (58%; \\nFigure 24, top panel). \\nRegarding the medical benefits of simple tests for \\nAlzheimer’s disease, there was stronger than anticipated \\ninterest in testing to inform clinical trial participation,  \\nwith nearly 1 in 2 respondents (48%) saying this would be  \\na reason for them to undergo testing.

Assuming they \\nwere diagnosed early, participants also expressed similarly \\nstrong interest in taking medications to lessen symptoms \\n(94%), as well as receiving education and support for \\nlifestyle changes (90%) (Figure 25, right panel). \\nApart from expressing interest in being treated with \\nanti-amyloid medication, Americans reported that if they \\nwere diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, information about \\nsuch treatments would be the most valuable. More broadly, \\nthey said they wanted education on the health impacts of \\nthe disease and health care planning.

Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) are \\noften on the frontlines of dementia diagnosis and care. \\nHowever, the 2020 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures \\nSpecial Report found that PCPs feel inadequately prepared \\nto care for patients with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, \\nciting difficulty answering questions, making diagnoses and \\nstaying current with the latest developments in \\nmanagement, treatment and screening/testing.\\n1072 Beyond \\nthese challenges faced by PCPs, communication barriers \\nexist between patients and clinicians. Both groups are \\noften uncomfortable raising concerns or discussing \\ncognitive symptoms, which can hinder crucial next steps \\nfor detection, diagnosis and treatment.\\nEnhancing patient-clinician dialogue is paramount not only \\nfor improving communication about next steps but for \\nengaging patients and caregivers in the dementia care \\njourney.

Experts must establish a clear delineation \\nbetween detection, which measures indicators of potential \\nrisk, and formal diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, which is a \\nmultifaceted process involving cognitive screening, other \\nassessments and, ultimately, clinical judgment. \\nPossible ethical considerations are heightened by the \\nanticipated FDA approval of these tests for use in primary \\ncare settings, where health care professionals may not be \\nas familiar with the critical distinction between detection \\nand diagnosis as specialists are, nor as equipped to \\naccurately convey this to patients as they weigh the \\nbenefits and risks of such tests. The health care community \\ncan learn from approaches used in clinical research \\nsettings, where presymptomatic biomarker information  \\nis carefully disclosed to study participants and care \\npartners.\\n281,1074 A pattern has been observed of participants \\nin research studies sharing biomarker test results with their \\ncare partners, a practice that may well continue when test \\nresults are available in the clinic.\\n1066,1074 \\nPre-counseling patients is an additional proactive approach \\nto respond to possible concerns related to biomarker test \\nresults. This approach can set realistic expectations about \\nwhat these tests can and cannot do, explain the possible \\nimplications of results both now and in the future, and \\neducate patients on the distinctions between detection \\nand diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Laying this \\ngroundwork for patients is vital given the increasing \\navailability of medical test results, including blood tests and \\nimaging, through patient portals — often without \\nsufficient context or clinical interpretation. Premature \\nrelease of results to patients before physicians are able to \\nprovide context and interpretation can lead to \\nmisinterpretation and emotional distress. \\nFurthermore, the potential for discrimination based on the \\nresults of biomarker testing, whether in medical settings, \\nthe workplace or the community, must be carefully \\nconsidered to determine how and with whom to share \\nresults. In the clinical research setting, concerns about \\nstigma and discrimination are cited as reasons not to share \\nbiomarker test results.\\n1066,1074\\nThis year’s Special Report found that individuals are \\npragmatic about the use of simple medical tests, such as \\nblood-based biomarker tests, for Alzheimer’s detection. \\nThey stated that they would use the results to plan ahead, \\nbe more aware of potential symptoms and seek treatment \\nearlier if symptoms appear.\\nAdvancing Legislative and Policy Initiatives to  \\nSecure Insurance Coverage for Current and Future \\nBiomarker Tests\\nCurrently, insurance coverage for biomarker testing, which \\nincludes imaging and blood tests, has not kept pace with \\nscientific discoveries and progress in treatment. The \\nmajority of states do not require insurance carriers to \\ncover biomarker testing, which gives private insurance \\nplans significant latitude in what they cover. As a result, \\nindividuals in these states may not have access to necessary \\nbiomarker testing. State Medicaid programs may elect to \\nnot cover biomarker testing for a wide variety of reasons, \\nfurther challenging access. Existing health care disparities \\nand challenges to obtaining a dementia diagnosis may be \\nexacerbated if new biomarker testing opportunities cannot \\nbe accessed. \\n“By ensuring access to necessary biomarker  \\ntesting, states can reduce the time it takes to  \\nreceive a diagnosis and enable access to new \\ndisease-modifying treatments and care planning.”\\nWith new evidence in the field of biomarker testing and \\nFDA consideration of blood-based amyloid biomarker \\ntesting tools expected in the near future, the Association is \\nengaging state governments to ensure adequate coverage \\nof biomarker tests and future access to diagnosis and \\ntreatment — reflecting the Association’s commitment to \\nthese priorities. \\nThe Alzheimer’s Association and the Alzheimer’s Impact \\nMovement (AIM) are part of a national coalition of patient \\nadvocates committed to ensuring insurance coverage for \\ncomprehensive biomarker testing. National coalition \\nmembers include the American Cancer Society Cancer \\nAction Network (ACS CAN), the ALS Association and the \\nArthritis Foundation. AIM is working with policymakers to \\nadvance and pass state legislation requiring insurers to \\ncover biomarker testing (Figure 27).

Public health \\nagencies play a critical role in educating the public and \\nhealth care providers about the latest research, best \\npractices and importance of early detection and diagnosis.  \\nAlzheimer’s Association initiatives with public health \\nagencies to increase understanding emphasize education \\nabout warning signs of dementia and improve access  \\nto diagnostic services and supports. Efforts also include \\nworking to lessen stigma around discussing memory and \\nthinking problems in communities and normalizing  \\nthese conversations in health care settings to help  \\nmake early detection and diagnosis more commonplace. \\nThe resulting materials and campaigns to promote early \\ndetection and diagnosis must be leveraged in every \\ncommunity and developed in culturally sensitive and \\nrelevant ways. The survey and focus group results from \\nthis and previous Special Reports can provide valuable \\ninsights to guide these efforts.\\nBeyond education, the Alzheimer’s Association also \\ncollaborates with state and local public health departments, \\ntribal health organizations, health systems and other \\nstakeholders to establish population-based strategies \\ncovering risk reduction, early detection and diagnosis, and \\nquality of care. These collaborative efforts are vital for \\ncreating a comprehensive and coordinated approach to \\naddressing Alzheimer’s and dementia across the life course.\\nThrough broad, ongoing initiatives and collaborations, \\npublic health has the power to significantly lessen the \\nburden of Alzheimer's disease on individuals, families and \\nthe nation as a whole.\\nSuccessful AIM Insurance Coverage Legislation Efforts (As of January 2025)*\\nFIGURE  27\\nEnacted legislation Enacted with some coverage States without coverage requirements\\n* AIM = Alzheimer's Impact Movement\"),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 118, 'page_label': '117'}, page_content='117\\nA1. Racial and ethnic identifiers : Facts and Figures keeps the racial \\nand ethnic terms used in source documents when describing \\nstudy findings. When not referring to data from specific studies, \\nadjectives such as “Black,” “Hispanic” and “White” may be used \\n(for example, Black populations and Hispanic communities).\\nA2. Estimated prevalence (number and proportion) of Americans age \\n65 and older with Alzheimer’s dementia for 2025: The estimated \\n7.2 million individuals ages 65 years and older with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia and the estimated numbers of individuals with \\nAlzheimer’s in each age group were reported from a study that \\nused data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) in \\ncombination with population projections from the U.S. Census.\\n293 \\nThe number, 7.2 million, is higher than estimated from previous \\nstudy that also combined CHAP and U.S. Census data. This is \\nbecause the more recent study used updated Census projections \\nand incorporated information from Hispanic/Latino American \\nindividuals. The proportion of the population with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia (among people age 65 and older and by age group) is \\ncalculated using as the numerators the numbers of people with \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, as reported by the recent study in \\nCHAP.\\n293 The denominators were the U.S. Census population \\nprojections for the specific age groups of interest.\\nA3. Differences between CHAP and HRS-HCAP estimates for \\nAlzheimer’s dementia prevalence: The number of people \\nestimated to have any form of dementia in the U.S. in 2016 from \\nthe Health and Retirement Study’s (HRS) Harmonized Cognitive \\nAssessment Protocol (HCAP; 4.92 million) is lower than the \\nCHAP estimate of how many people were living with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia only (6.07 million).\\n173 This is because of differences in \\ndementia ascertainment between the two studies: both studies \\nused scores on batteries of cognitive tests, but the HRS-HCAP \\nstudy additionally required an informant report of functional \\nimpairment (i.e. disability). Because the more stringent threshold \\nfor dementia in HRS-HCAP may miss people with mild \\nAlzheimer’s dementia, the Association believes that the larger \\nCHAP estimates may be a more relevant estimate of the burden \\nof Alzheimer’s dementia in the United States.\\nA4. Criteria for identifying people with Alzheimer’s or other \\ndementias in the Framingham Heart Study:  From 1975 to 2009, \\n7,901 people from the Framingham Study who had survived free \\nof dementia to at least age 45, and 5,937 who had survived free \\nof dementia until at least age 65 were followed for incidence of \\ndementia.340 Diagnosis of dementia was made according to the \\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th \\nEdition (DSM-IV) criteria and required that the participant \\nsurvive for at least 6 months after onset of symptoms. Standard \\ndiagnostic criteria (the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria from 1984) \\nwere used to diagnose Alzheimer’s dementia. The definition of \\nAlzheimer’s and other dementias used in the Framingham Study \\nwas very strict; if a definition that included milder disease and \\ndisease of less than six months’ duration were used, lifetime risks \\nof Alzheimer’s and other dementias would be higher than those \\nestimated by this study.\\nA5. Projected number of people with Alzheimer’s dementia, \\n2020-2060: This figure comes from the CHAP study.\\n293  \\nOther projections are somewhat lower (see, for example, \\nBrookmeyer et al.\\n1075) because they relied on more conservative \\nmethods for counting people who currently have Alzheimer’s \\ndementia.\\nA3 Nonetheless, these estimates are statistically \\nconsistent with each other, and all projections suggest \\nsubstantial growth in the number of people with Alzheimer’s \\ndementia over the coming decades.\\nA6. Annual mortality rate due to Alzheimer’s disease by state:  \\nUnadjusted death rates are presented rather than age-adjusted \\ndeath rates in order to provide a clearer depiction of the burden \\nof mortality for each state. States such as Florida with larger \\npopulations of older people will have a larger burden of mortality \\ndue to Alzheimer’s — a burden that appears smaller relative to \\nother states when the rates are adjusted for age.\\nA7. Number of family and other unpaid caregivers of people with \\nAlzheimer’s or other dementias: To calculate this number, the \\nAlzheimer’s Association started with data from the Behavioral \\nRisk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Since 2016, all \\nstates and the District of Columbia utilized the BRFSS caregiver \\nmodule. This module identified respondents age 18 and over \\nwho had provided any regular care or assistance during the past \\nmonth to a family member or friend who had a health problem, \\nlong-term illness or disability. The module asks a series of \\nfollow-up questions, including asking the caregiver to identify \\nwhat the main health problem, long-term illness, or disability that \\nthe person they care for has. One of the reported condition \\ncategories is “Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other cognitive \\nimpairment.” In the BRFSS surveys conducted in 2019 and after, \\nan additional follow-up question was included, asking if the \\ncaregiving recipient also had dementia in addition to their main \\ncondition. Prior to 2019, the survey did not include caregivers of \\nrecipients for whom dementia was not their main condition, so \\nthese numbers were imputed using data collected in 2019 by the \\nNational Alliance for Caregiving (NAC)/AARP survey. The NAC/\\nAARP survey asked respondents age 18 and over whether they \\nwere providing unpaid care for a relative or friend age 18 or \\nolder or had provided such care during the past 12 months. \\nRespondents who answered affirmatively were then asked about \\nthe health problems of the person for whom they provided care: \\n11% of respondents reported dementia as the main condition of \\ntheir care recipient, while 26% of all respondents reported the \\npresence of dementia. Using this ratio in combination with \\nBRFSS data, the Alzheimer’s Association was able to determine \\nthe percentage of adults in all states and the District of Columbia \\nwho are caregivers for individuals living with Alzheimer’s or \\nanother dementia. These percentages were applied to the \\nestimated number of people age 18 and older in each state in \\nJuly 2024, using U.S. Census Bureau data available at: https://\\nwww.census. gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.html. \\nThis resulted in a total of 11,926 million Alzheimer’s and \\ndementia caregivers across all 50 states and the District  \\nof Columbia.\\nA8. Number of hours of unpaid care: The BRFSS survey asks \\ncaregivers to identify, within five time frames, the number of \\nhours they provide care in an average week. Using the method \\ndeveloped by Rabarison and colleagues,\\n517 the Alzheimer’s \\nAssociation assumed the midpoint of each time frame was the \\naverage number of hours for each caregiver within that time \\nframe and then calculated the overall average number of hours \\nof weekly care provided by dementia caregivers in each state. \\nThis number was then converted to a yearly average and \\nmultiplied by the number of caregivers in each state\\nA7 to \\ndetermine the total number of hours of care provided. When \\nadded together, across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, \\nthe total number of hours provided by Alzheimer’s and dementia \\ncaregivers is 19.161 billion hours.\\nA9. Value of unpaid caregiving: For each state, the hourly value of \\ncare was determined as the average of the state minimum hourly \\nwage\\n1076 and the most recently available state median hourly \\ncost of a home health aide. (For Nevada, the minimum wage used \\nwas the average of the minimum wage for those who are not \\nprovided health insurance and the minimum wage for those who \\nare provided health insurance.)\\n992 The average for each state was \\nthen multiplied by the total number of hours of unpaid care in \\nthat state\\nA8 to derive the total value of unpaid care. Adding the \\ntotals from all states and the District of Columbia resulted in an \\neconomic value of $413.452 billion for dementia caregiving in \\nthe United States in 2024.\\nAppendices\\nEnd Notes\\nAppendices'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 119, 'page_label': '118'}, page_content='118\\nAlzheimer’s Association. 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures. Alzheimers Dement 2025;21(5).\\nA10. The 2014 Alzheimer’s Association Women and Alzheimer’s Poll: \\nThis poll questioned a nationally representative sample of  \\n3,102 American adults about their attitudes, knowledge and \\nexperiences related to Alzheimer’s and dementia from Jan. 9, \\n2014, to Jan. 29, 2014. An additional 512 respondents who \\nprovided unpaid help to a relative or friend with Alzheimer’s or  \\na related dementia were asked questions about their care \\nprovision. Random selections of telephone numbers from \\nlandline and cell phone exchanges throughout the United States \\nwere conducted. One individual per household was selected \\nfrom the landline sample, and cell phone respondents were \\nselected if they were 18 years old or older. Interviews were \\nadministered in English and Spanish. The poll “oversampled” \\nHispanics/Latinos, selected from U.S. Census tracts with higher \\nthan an 8% concentration of this group. A list sample of Asian \\nAmericans was also utilized to oversample this group. A general \\npopulation weight was used to adjust for number of adults in the \\nhousehold and telephone usage; the second stage of this weight \\nbalanced the sample to estimated U.S. population characteristics. \\nA weight for the caregiver sample accounted for the increased \\nlikelihood of female and White respondents in the caregiver \\nsample. Sampling weights were also created to account for the \\nuse of two supplemental list samples. The resulting interviews \\ncomprise a probability-based, nationally representative sample \\nof U.S. adults. A caregiver was defined as an adult over age 18 \\nwho, in the past 12 months, provided unpaid care to a relative or \\nfriend age 50 or older with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. \\nQuestionnaire design and interviewing were conducted by Abt \\nSRBI of New York.\\nA11. Lewin Model on Alzheimer’s and dementia costs: These numbers \\ncome from a model created for the Alzheimer’s Association by \\nthe Lewin Group. The model estimates total payments for health \\ncare, long-term care and hospice — as well as state-by-state \\nMedicaid spending — for people with Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias. The model was updated by the Lewin Group in \\nJanuary 2015 (updating previous model) and June 2015 \\n(addition of state-by-state Medicaid estimates). The Lewin \\nModel’s state-specific Medicaid costs for 2025 are based on an \\nearlier estimate of state prevalence than reported here (Weuve J, \\nHebert LE, Scherr PA, Evans DA. Prevalence of Alzheimer disease \\nin U.S. states. Epidemiology 2015;26(1):E4-6) and are inflated to \\n2024 dollars. \\nA12. All cost estimates were inflated to year 2024 dollars using the \\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): All cost estimates were inflated \\nusing the seasonally adjusted average prices for medical care \\nservices from all urban consumers. The relevant item within \\nmedical care services was used for each cost element. For \\nexample, the medical care item within the CPI was used to inflate \\ntotal health care payments; the hospital services item within the \\nCPI was used to inflate hospital payments; and the nursing home \\nand adult day services item within the CPI was used to inflate \\nnursing home payments.\\nA13. Average annual per-person payments for health care and \\nlong-term care services for Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and \\nolder with and without Alzheimer’s or other dementias:  \\nPayments are unadjusted, and therefore, do not account for \\ndifferences in patient characteristics, such as age or sex. \\nAdditionally, payments are based on health care utilization and \\npayments in 2018 for the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey \\nand 2019 for Medicare claims data, prior to the COVID-19 \\npandemic, and do not reflect any post-pandemic-related \\nchanges in utilization.\\nA14. Enrollment in fee-for-service Medicare versus Medicare Part C:  \\nIndividuals eligible for Medicare can enroll in traditional \\nMedicare, also referred to as fee-for-service Medicare and \\noriginal Medicare, or Medicare Advantage, also referred to as \\nMedicare Part C.\\n1077 With traditional Medicare, beneficiaries can \\nreceive care from any doctor or hospital in the United States \\nthat accepts Medicare. Generally, beneficiaries can seek care \\nfrom a specialist without a referral. Traditional Medicare has \\nfixed cost sharing, which includes coinsurance of 20% of the \\nMedicare-approved amount for services covered by Part B after \\nthe deductible is met. Individuals enrolled in traditional Medicare \\ncan also enroll in Medicare Supplemental Insurance (also \\nreferred to as Medigap) to help cover the out-of-pocket costs. \\nTraditional Medicare does not have an annual limit on the \\namount beneficiaries pay out-of-pocket. Benefits are the same \\nfor all individuals enrolled in traditional Medicare. Individuals \\nenrolled in traditional Medicare can also enroll in a Medicare  \\nPart D plan to cover some of the costs of prescription drugs. \\nMedicare Part D enrollment has a separate premium. With \\nMedicare Advantage, individuals must enroll in a specific private \\nplan. Premiums, benefits and out-of-pocket costs may vary \\nacross plans. Medicare Advantage plans have an annual limit on \\nthe amount individuals pay out-of-pocket. Individuals enrolled in \\na Medicare Advantage plan are not allowed to enroll in Medigap. \\nMedicare Advantage plans are also allowed to offer additional \\nbenefits not included in traditional Medicare, such as vision, \\nhearing and dental services as well as some non-health care \\nbenefits, such as transportation costs and gym memberships. \\nMany Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug \\ncoverage (Medicare Part D). Individuals enrolled in a Medicare \\nAdvantage plan have a specific network of doctors and hospitals \\nthat enrollees need to use for services to be paid by the \\nMedicare Advantage plan. Additionally, individuals enrolled in a \\nMedicare Advantage plan may need a referral to see a specialist. \\nEnrollment in Medicare Advantage has increased dramatically \\nover the past decade, with 51% of all Medicare beneficiaries \\nenrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2023 compared with \\n29% in 2013.\\n1000\\nA15. Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Report:  These data come \\nfrom an analysis of findings from the 2018 Medicare Current \\nBeneficiary Survey (MCBS). The analysis was conducted for the \\nAlzheimer’s Association by Health Care Cost Institute.\\n941 The \\nMCBS, a continuous survey of a nationally representative sample \\nof about 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries, is linked to Medicare \\nclaims. The survey is supported by the U.S. Centers for Medicare \\n& Medicaid Services (CMS). For community-dwelling survey \\nparticipants, MCBS interviews are conducted in person three \\ntimes a year with the Medicare beneficiary or a proxy \\nrespondent if the beneficiary is not able to respond. For survey \\nparticipants who are living in a nursing home or another \\nresidential care setting, such as an assisted living residence, \\nretirement home or a long-term care unit in a hospital or mental \\nhealth facility, MCBS interviews are conducted with a staff \\nmember designated by the facility administrator as the most \\nappropriate to answer the questions.

Differences in estimated costs reported by Hurd and colleagues:  \\nHurd and colleagues940 estimated per-person costs using data \\nfrom participants in ADAMS, a cohort in which all individuals \\nunderwent diagnostic assessments for dementia. One reason \\nthat the per-person costs estimated by Hurd and colleagues are \\nlower than those reported in Facts and Figures  is that ADAMS, \\nwith its diagnostic evaluations of everyone in the study, is more \\nlikely than MCBS to have identified individuals with less severe or \\nundiagnosed Alzheimer’s. By contrast, the individuals with \\nAlzheimer’s registered by MCBS are likely to be those with more \\nsevere, and therefore more costly, illness. A second reason is that \\nthe Hurd et al. estimated costs reflect an effort to isolate the \\nincremental costs associated with Alzheimer’s and other \\ndementias (those costs attributed only to dementia),while the \\nper-person costs in 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures \\nincorporate all costs of caring for people with the disease \\n(regardless of whether the expenditure was related to dementia \\nor a coexisting condition).\\n•  C ommunity-dwelling survey participants who answered yes to  \\n t he MCBS question, “Has a doctor ever told you that you had  \\n A lzheimer’s disease or dementia?” Proxy responses to this  \\n qu estion were accepted.\\n• Survey participants who were living in a nursing home or other  \\n r esidential care setting and had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease  \\n o r dementia in their medical record.\\n• Survey participants who had at least one Medicare claim with  \\n a d iagnostic code for Alzheimer’s or other dementias in 2018.  \\n T he claim could be for any Medicare service, including hospital,  \\n s killed nursing facility, outpatient medical care, home health   \\n c are, hospice or physician, or other health care provider visit.  \\n T he diagnostic codes used to identify survey participants with  \\n A lzheimer’s or other dementias are G30.0, G30.1, G30.8, G30.9,  \\n G 31.01, G31.09, G31.83, F.01.50, F01.51, F02.80, F02.81,  \\n F 03.90, F03.91 and F10.27.\\nCosts from the MCBS analysis are based on responses from 2018 \\nand reported in 2024 dollars.\\nAppendices'),\n Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-03-31T17:30:21-05:00', 'author': \"Alzheimer's Association\", 'moddate': '2025-04-23T12:08:50-05:00', 'title': \"Alzheimer's Association 2025 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures\", 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/alzheimers.pdf', 'total_pages': 152, 'page': 121, 'page_label': '120'}, page_content='120\\nAlzheimer’s Association. 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.

For survey \\nparticipants who are living in a nursing home or another \\nresidential care setting, such as an assisted living residence, \\nretirement home or a long-term care unit in a hospital or mental \\nhealth facility, MCBS interviews are conducted with a staff \\nmember designated by the facility administrator as the most \\nappropriate to answer the questions.
